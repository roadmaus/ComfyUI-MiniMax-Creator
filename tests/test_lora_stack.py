"""Which loader a family's LoRAs arrive on, and what a misplaced file does.

`lora.py` had one path: the vendored `h3lora` stack, which exists because the
stock loader is wrong on the quantized checkpoints nearly everybody runs H3 on.
That argument is about H3's weights and not about LoRAs, and a second video
family arrived with adapters of its own — LTX 2.5 takes LTX 2.3's, which is
Lightricks' own word — that core already knows how to place.

So the loader is the family's, declared once in `registry.LORA_STACK`, and this
suite holds three things about the split:

- every family says which stack it takes, and H3 is the only one on the
  vendored one;
- a core-stack family's LoRAs are patched the way `LoraLoaderModelOnly` patches
  them — model only, in stack order, at the strength the entry carries, off the
  file this pack already has in memory;
- a file that places *no* key raises. Nothing here inspects a LoRA to decide
  whether it belongs — what a file was trained for is not knowable from it with
  any confidence, and refusing on a guess would refuse the one that works — but
  a stack that patched nothing at all is a render that is about to come out as
  though the LoRA were not there, and that is worth a minute of somebody's life.

Core's own machinery is stubbed rather than driven: what is being tested is this
pack's dispatch and its accounting, and `test_h3lora.py` is where a real model
gets patched.
