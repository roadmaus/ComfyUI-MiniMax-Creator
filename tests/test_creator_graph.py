"""What `MiniMaxH3Creator.execute` wires up, and that it agrees with the Timeline.

The Creator owns its sampler now, so like the Timeline it returns a subgraph
rather than tensors and the thing worth checking is the graph. Nothing is
sampled — the expansion can be inspected without a model or a denoising step.

    COMFYUI_PATH=~/ComfyUI <comfy-venv>/bin/python3 tests/test_creator_graph.py

The load-bearing case is the last one: a Creator render and a one-segment
one-pass timeline must emit the *same* graph. That is the whole claim behind
`render.py` existing, and it is the assertion that fails if either node grows a
private copy of the wiring.
