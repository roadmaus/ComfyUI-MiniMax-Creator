"""Where this pack's code lives, and how to load either half of it.

Most of the suite needs a path into the package: the pure Python modules, so
they can be imported without booting ComfyUI, and the frontend modules, so node
can be pointed at them. Every suite derived the repo root and then spelled the
layout out again — `os.path.join(ROOT, "compile.py")`, `os.path.join(ROOT,
"js", "minimax_creator", "state.js")` — which put the directory structure in
twenty-five files that all had to agree.

They did not. The eight mirror suites alone carried three spellings of node's
eval flag (`-e`, `--eval`, and `--eval` with the arguments in another position)
and four names for the fake package they load modules into (`mmc`, `mmcpkg`,
`mmc_outputs`, and none at all). None of that was a decision anybody made.

**The layout is `PY_ROOT` and `WEB_ROOT` and nothing else.** Moving the
frontend, or moving a module into a family package, is an edit here rather than
twenty-five edits that have to be kept in step — which is what makes the
multi-family refactor a change to the code instead of a change to the code and
its whole test suite at once.

`skip_without_node()` must be called before anything else in a suite that shells
out: the import is the point where a machine without node should bow out, and it
exits rather than raising so `harness.py` reports a skip and not a crash.
