"""The frontend loads, and all three node bodies actually mount.

Everything else in `tests/` checks what the backend builds. This checks the half
that runs in the browser, because the failure it exists for is silent from
Python's side and total from the user's: one throw anywhere in the module graph
and `app.registerExtension` never runs, so every node in the pack renders as its
raw widgets and nothing says why.

That has now happened twice for reasons no syntax check could catch — the CSS
lives in template literals (one per module under `web/creator/styles/`,
concatenated by `styles.js`), so a backtick inside a CSS comment ends the string
and turns the rest of the stylesheet into code that still parses. `node --check`
passes; the extension is dead.

So this imports the extension for real, against a DOM small enough to write down
(`dom.mjs`, generated below) and stubs for the three ComfyUI modules the pack
imports. Then it builds each node's body and reads the rendered text back. It is
not a rendering test — the shim has no layout and no CSS — it answers "did it
mount, and is the expected furniture in it".
