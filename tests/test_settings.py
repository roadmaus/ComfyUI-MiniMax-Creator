"""What the settings file is allowed to hold, and what a broken one reads as.

Runs standalone — `python tests/test_settings.py` — with no torch and no
ComfyUI, the same way `test_outputs.py` does, because `settings.py` keeps its
one ComfyUI import inside `path()` for exactly that reason.

The cases worth pinning are the two ends of a preferences file's life: what the
settings page is allowed to store, and what the save node reads when the file on
disk is missing, half-written or edited by hand into something the encoder has
no answer for. A render must not fail over a preference — but it must not
quietly use a value nobody chose either, which is why "unusable" reads as the
default the page will then show rather than as whatever was closest.
