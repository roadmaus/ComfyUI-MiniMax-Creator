"""`sampling.resolve`: what the row is, and which half of the node said so.

    python3 tests/test_sampling.py

The row moved off the widgets and into the blob so a second model family can
declare its own controls — see `sampling.py`. What that module has to get right
is the seam between the two stores, because everything already queued is on the
far side of it: a workflow saved before the move carries no `sampling` block and
must render at its widgets, and one saved by an older frontend may carry a block
missing whatever was added since.

So the fallback is per field rather than per block, and most of what is below is
about that. `tests/test_golden_graph.py` covers the other half — that a blob row
and a widget row reach the same graph, and that neither reaches the segment
node's cache key.
