# Tools

In the fullscreen editor, press the **Continuity** wordmark at the top to open
the tools dashboard. The benches live there; the smaller tools live on the
node's rail.

![The tools dashboard](img/dashboard.png)

**Go to** switches between the pre-stage and the shot, each opening over the
piece you already have. **Tools** opens a bench on it.

## ControlNet bench

Turns footage or a photograph you already have into a guide file a render can
follow. Drop in a clip or a picture, cut the span you want, choose a tracing,
and it writes the guide into `input/continuity/control/`. No node is added and
no workflow is touched.

The tracings:

| Tracing | What it draws | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| Edges | hard outlines (Canny) | nothing |
| Lines | a drawing that follows the form | nothing |
| Blocks | the frame flattened into fields of one colour | nothing |
| Luma | the tones with the colour taken out | nothing |
| Blur | the masses and nothing else | nothing |
| As shot | no tracing; just cuts the span or strips the soundtrack | nothing |
| Depth | a depth map (Depth Anything 3) | a model, see [models.md](models.md#the-controlnet-bench) |
| Pose | a skeleton (SDPose) | a model, see [models.md](models.md#the-controlnet-bench) |
| Matte | a white-on-black mask of a named subject (SAM 3), for video inpainting: everything outside the white stays the source clip, only the subject is regenerated. Invert it to keep the subject and replace the world. | the SAM 3 checkpoint |

The five arithmetic tracings redraw live while you drag a slider, and pressing
play traces the clip as it runs. Depth, Pose and Matte run a model per frame,
so you press **Trace** and the written file is what plays back. The preview is
one rectangle with a draggable seam: footage on the left, tracing on the
right.

**Send to pre-stage** makes the guide the still's init image; **Send to the
shot** attaches it as a reference you can cite with `@`. Neither is required;
the file is in the picker either way.

## Blockout bench

Starts from nothing at all: block a scene out of grey boxes, walk a camera
through it, and render a guide along the camera's path. No model, no download,
no queue. The renderer is arithmetic in the browser, and what is on the glass
is exactly what gets written into `input/continuity/blockout/`.

![The blockout bench: a subject block selected with its move handles, the shot camera drawn as a frustum with its path on the floor, and the staging narrated in the foot](img/blockout.png)

The floor opens bare. Add a **Block**, **Wall** or **Post**, or start from one
of the five arrangements in the rail (Two-shot, Corridor, Interview, Street
corner, or Bare floor), each of which brings its own camera and its own move,
so what lands on the glass is a shot rather than an assembly kit. Starting from
one replaces whatever is there.

### Two cameras

The **shot camera** is the one that gets written. It is drawn where it stands,
as a frustum in blue, with its path along the floor and a diamond at every
mark. **Free look** flies a second camera around it that touches nothing: WASD
walks, Q and E drop and rise, drag orbits, shift-drag slides, the wheel zooms,
and `F` (or a double-click) swings the view round to look at whatever is
selected. Nothing you do in free look changes the file, stales a result, or
alters a word of the prose.

**Through the lens** stands you in the shot camera, where the glass is the lens
and every gesture is a word the model was trained on: drag pans and tilts,
shift-drag trucks and pedestals, the wheel pushes in and pulls out. **Put the
camera here** moves the shot camera to where you are standing; **Go to the
camera** flies the view back to it.

Frame the shot and press **Mark**, frame the next one and mark that; the clip
walks the marks in order over a duration you set. One mark (or none) writes a
still instead. Pressing a mark's name puts the camera back on it.

### Editing the set

Click a piece to select it. Its handles hang off it on the glass. **Move**
(`1`) slides it along the world axes or, dragged by its body, across the floor;
**Turn** (`2`) gives it three rings; **Size** (`3`) three square caps. `Shift+D`
duplicates the selection, `X` removes it, and **Snap** rounds a place to 0.25 m
or a metre and a turn to 15°. The rail carries the same numbers as figures, in
the handles' own colours, and they stay in step with whatever the glass does.

The **Frame** pill carries the same aspect popover the strip does: the shape
grid over one orientation switch, off the family's own manifest, so what is on
offer is what the weights will accept. The pill says the pixels beside the
ratio, because a guide is written at that family's native canvas for the shape
you pick: what the file holds is the size the render will read it at.

### What the glass shows

**Stage** is the set as you handle it: clay, the grid with its five-metre
lines and coloured world axes, the selection ring, the handles, the camera, the
names. **Depth** (or whichever pass is selected in Output) is the frame exactly
as the file will hold it, with no staging aids on it at all.

Four outputs, three of them wearing the ControlNet bench's own names:

| Pass | What it writes |
|---|---|
| As staged | no tracing, just the clay render itself, as footage, for the families that read a plain clip or picture as a reference or an init |
| Depth | near bright, far dark, the map Depth Anything draws, taken from the geometry, so nothing is guessed |
| Blocks | each piece one flat field of colour |
| Lines | the set's edges, white on black |

The grid, the selection ring, the handles, the camera and the names are staging
aids: they live on the Stage view and never reach the written file.

A piece can be told who or what it is. **Plays** hands it to a cast member
(the block wears their chip hue on the stage side, never in the written file),
and **Called** gives a thing its word ("table", "doorway"). Named pieces are
written into the staging: the bench computes who stands where in frame from
its own projection, and the foot narrates the whole of it as you work:
*"@anna stands at centre in the midground; a table at frame left in the
foreground. The camera pushes in toward @anna at slow speed."* The camera half
is in the motion-type, amplitude and speed vocabulary the H3 prompt spec
defines. **Copy** hands you the prose to paste straight into a prompt, where
`@anna` becomes her references by the same substitution every prompt already
does. No model reads identity out of pixels. A depth map is identity-free by
construction, and even mask-injection systems bind a reference to its region
through the prompt, which is why the words are the mechanism, and why they are
generated rather than hand-written.

The finished guide goes through the same doors a tracing does, and the scene
itself is saved as a small `.json` beside the clip, including each named
piece's screen box at every mark, for conditioning schemes that can ground
against layout when one arrives.

## Upscale bench

Takes any still or clip (from this pack or not) and makes it bigger or
repairs it. Results land in `output/continuity/upscaled/`, beside your
renders, and can be attached to the shot or pre-stage from there.

Two backends:

- **Sharpen** is a GAN upscaler (anything spandrel loads) through core's own
  tiling. It resolves detail that is already in the picture and invents none:
  a face comes back the same face, and soft footage comes back soft and
  bigger, which is the honest answer for it.
- **Restore** is SeedVR2. It repairs rather than enlarges: compression
  artefacts, grain, the softness of a small frame. On a clip it reads several
  frames at once so movement doesn't boil. **Frames at a time** is the dial to
  lower if a long shot runs out of VRAM. Much slower than Sharpen, and the
  right answer for footage with something wrong with it.

The preview shows one square of the source at the size it will actually come
out, split against plain resampling, which is the comparison worth making.
**Try it here** runs the backend on that square alone, so you can dial
settings in seconds instead of re-running the whole file. On a clip, the trim
bar cuts the span first, and **This frame** takes just the frame under the
playhead as a picture.

A third entry, **Refine (DLSS 5)**, is the neural refiner below at the size
the picture already is — on the bench so the tile can be judged against the
plain source, and offered as a **Then refine** switch on Sharpen and Restore
so the material is drawn onto the enlarged picture.

Files for both backends: [models.md](models.md#the-upscale-bench).

## Neural refiner (DLSS 5)

NVIDIA's DLSS 5 neural renderer, run outside a game through the open-source
[MLX-DLSS](https://github.com/iamwavecut/MLX-DLSS) port (Apache-2.0), as a
**material pass**: skin, hair, fabric, contact shadows and subsurface,
re-drawn at the size the picture already is. It is not an upscaler — the port
measured DLSS Super Resolution and left it out, because without a game's
motion vectors it loses to Lanczos. Expect strong results on figures and
faces, and odd ones on flat, graphic or abstract work: it was trained on game
frames.

![Each style preset at its default, against the source, at 1:1](img/dlss-presets.png)

**The presets and what they open at.** `standard` is what the driver runs;
`natural` and `cinematic` move the model's style index one and two steps; and
each arrives with its own opening strengths, measured on stills rather than
taken from the model's own answer. That answer is 1 on both strengths, and on
the colour half it is a grade: at 1 it darkens skin, flattens knitwear and
muddies brick, which is a tone change nobody asks a material pass for. So every
preset opens at colour 0, where the tone is left alone and the material work
survives — `standard` and `cinematic` at detail 1.25, `natural`, which is the
most eager of the three on skin, at 1. Switching preset carries the new one's
strengths onto any dial you have not moved yourself.

`neutral` is the exception, and it is not a style: upstream defines it with the
model's local tone *and* local structure at zero, so both strengths have nothing
to scale and the pass comes back within half a level of the source whatever the
dials say. It is there to turn the character off, not to tune.

Above detail 2 the pass stops describing material and starts inventing it —
skin goes waxy, brick embosses, and lit edges pick up blue-orange fringes — so
the dial stops at 4 rather than at the model's own 8.

It is available wherever this pack handles a picture:

- **On a pre-stage still** — the `DLSS 5` pill on the sampler row, with the
  preset, the detail and colour strengths, the blend, and a processing scale
  (the network run on the picture resampled up and brought back; finer at 2,
  about four times the memory).
- **On a render** — the same pill on the Creator and the Timeline. Every pass
  is refined after the whole reel is finished, with the previous frame's
  result reprojected into the next through optical flow, so a clip does not
  boil. It runs after ReDetail if that is on, at whatever size the frames
  leave at, and a clip always runs at its own size.
- **On the upscale bench** — the Refine entry, and the Then refine switch on
  the other two.
- **As a node** — *Continuity Neural Refine (DLSS 5)* takes any IMAGE and an
  optional MASK. The mask drives where it refines, per pixel.

Memory is about a gigabyte of VRAM per megapixel of the picture at float32,
half in the fast precision, and the processing scale multiplies it by its
square. Every surface prints the estimate before it runs.

**Setting it up.** Nothing of NVIDIA's ships with this pack. The weights live
inside `nvngx_dlssnr.dll` (file version 310.8.0.0), which NVIDIA distributes
in its Streamline SDK (`bin/x64/nvngx_dlssnr.dll`) and with games that carry
DLSS 5. On the settings page, under *Neural refiner*:

1. Point the box at your DLL and press **Check**. The file is hashed and
   compared against the port's table; only the supported build is accepted.
2. Press **Extract weights**. The port's extraction code runs locally and
   writes `models/dlss/dlssnr-weights-logical.safetensors`. The DLL is never
   read again, and nothing is downloaded at any step.

The pills and the bench say what is missing until that is done. The port's
code travels with the pack (`creator/mlxdlss/`, Apache-2.0, re-synced by
`tools/vendor_mlxdlss.py`), so there is nothing else to install. Its accuracy
figures — within 0.005 of the driver on game renders — are its own, not this
pack's. Optical flow for the clip history uses OpenCV where a ComfyUI already
has it and falls back to zero motion where it does not; the log says which.

## Contact sheet

On the pre-stage's rail. Lays nine frames of a clip out as one gutterless
picture, so an edit model (Qwen Image Edit or Flux 2 Klein) can be asked about
a whole shot at once and holds the subject across the tiles. The same tool
cuts the edited sheet back into nine frames in the input folder. Browser-side
arithmetic: no queue, no weights.

## Presets

**Presets** on the rail saves a setup you can put back: a whole piece, one
shot off a strip, a pre-stage, or one cast member. Applying is per-section:
tick just *look* and *speed* to drop a canvas and a step count onto a shot you
already wrote, leaving the prose alone. A preset saves the sampler row of the
family it was made on and won't push it onto another family's shot. **From a
render** turns a finished MP4 or PNG back into a preset, from the workflow the
file already carries.

## The style atlas

![The style atlas](img/style-atlas.png)

The library's last tab is a catalogue of **941 looks**, indexed from
[ostris/minimax_h3_1k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ostris/minimax_h3_1k)
by [hoodtronik's Style Atlas](https://github.com/hoodtronik/minimax-h3-style-atlas),
each with the frames it was cut from. They aren't adjectives somebody thought
of; they're the exact strings the model was captioned with. Applying one swaps
the lead of your prompt rather than stacking on top, so trying six looks gives
you six prompts, not six paragraphs. The atlas is vendored (about 40 MB, most
of this repo's size) and nothing is downloaded at runtime.

## LoRA manager

A full-screen manager over `models/loras`, with cards built from whatever
sidecar metadata sits beside each file (CiviMeta, Civitai Helper,
ComfyUI-Lora-Manager formats all read). Per-LoRA strength, trigger words
prefixed at compile time and shown under the chips, versions grouped per
model, favourites, and saved stacks. Strengths you set are remembered.

Each entry names the checkpoints it claims. A LoRA that would match no keys on
the checkpoint it lands on is refused rather than quietly rendering an
unchanged video.

On MiniMax H3 each card also carries a **Soundtrack** dial. H3 generates picture
and sound together through one transformer, so an adapter conditions the audio
whether it was trained to or not. And it was: video and audio are denoised
jointly during training, so a file built from clips whose sound was silent,
scraped or absent has learned that too, and emits it under every render it is
in. The usual symptom is mumbled speech in a shot where nobody was meant to
speak. Turning the dial down damps that file's hold on the soundtrack while
leaving its hold on the picture at full strength. It damps rather than mutes:
H3 attends over video, text and audio as one sequence, so the adapter still
reaches the sound through the tower. Full is the default and what you set is
remembered per file.

## ReDetail

LTX 2.5 only: a second pass over a finished render through Lightricks' x2
IC-LoRA. It re-renders rather than resolves, inventing detail as it goes,
which is why it lives in a render's own settings and not on the upscale bench.

## Guide LoRA pass

MiniMax H3 only: a second pass over a finished render through a **guide
LoRA**, a file trained with the source clip pinned as an *aligned guide* so
the model is handed a pixel-for-pixel correspondence rather than a
description. The two published so far are
[Alissonerdx's](https://huggingface.co/Alissonerdx/Minimax-H3-ComfyUI)
`minimax_h3_lms` ("a little more sharpness") and `minimax_h3_style_transfer`,
both rank-64 files over Ref2VA, trained on ostris's ai-toolkit fork. Drop
them in `models/loras`.

The `guide LoRA` pill sits on the sampler row of the Creator and the
Timeline, beside `DLSS 5`. Switch it on, pick the file, and its caption is
put in the prompt box for you — the sharpener's published one, or the trigger
words on the file's card; a style file wants the style written there instead. Every written pass is
then generated again from noise, the whole schedule, with itself encoded and
pinned at frame 0 as one guide block, under the file. It runs at the size the
pass was written, on its own rig rather than the piece's: the published one —
8 steps of euler on the checkpoints' own shifts, with the distill the files
were trained against (`minimax_h3_ref2v_turbo_4step`, any `ref2v…turbo` file
in `models/loras`) at 1.0 beside the guide file — and on the checkpoint the
file was trained against whatever the cards route to. Without that distill
installed the piece's own turbo file stands in, and the pass is measurably
under-driven: a style comes through by half, a sharpen barely. The
soundtrack rides through untouched.

It runs over the whole reel after the last pass and before ReDetail and the
neural refiner, never inline at a seam: a sharpened tail handed to the next
shot as its anchor is a ratchet, the same one the DLSS refiner was measured
to have. Each part is generated on its own, so across a feathered seam two
generations meet; the guide is near-clean in training and the output is
locked to it, so the join is expected to hold. That is unmeasured on a real
render as of 2026-09-12, as is the pass at canvases past the 0.59 MP the
files' examples were made at.

Cost is a second full generation per pass. Nothing else is loaded: the
checkpoint, the encoder and the VAE are the render's own.

### Restyle

The style file is the same pass with a picture. Press **Restyle** on a
finished render (the chip beside Gallery), or *Pick a look from the style
atlas* in the pill's popover: the library opens on the Style tab as a picker,
with your render's own frame on the left of a wipe and every look you press
on the right. Under it is what the file is told, in the grammar it was
trained on: the trigger, "Re-render this video in the style of the picture:",
then the look's descriptor cut into three to five attributes as chips. Strike
one, add one; a chip that names a studio or a franchise is marked, because a
name there makes the model stop looking at the picture. **Restyle this
render** writes the style file, the look's frame as the picture and the
caption onto the pass and queues the node. The written passes are cached, so
only the pass samples. The style file is found by its name under
`models/loras`; without one the button says where to get it.
