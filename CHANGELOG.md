# Changelog

Back by request. Every entry opens with a line saying what changed; the
paragraph under it says how and why, and from 3.0 down that paragraph is kept
exactly as it was written, wall of text and all.

## Unreleased

**SLA's sparsity is on the row: pick `attention sla` and the pill extends with
a `sparsity` stepper, the way Spectrum's extends with its blend (#78).** The
number is the fraction of key blocks SLA skips and the one its quality trade
turns on, and it used to be whatever the installed pack defaulted to — which
has moved between 0.80 and 0.90 across the pack's releases, so two machines
with the same workflow could render differently. It now defaults to 0.85,
what the lightx2v SLA turbo LoRA was distilled against, and goes down to 0
(dense, node still applied) and up to the pack's 0.95 ceiling; below about
0.60 the sparse kernel is slower than dense, which the tooltip says. The field
is blob-only like VDN's stage — the node's widget slots are frozen — so a
workflow saved before this renders at 0.85 rather than at the pack's default.

**Motion fix: a switch on the card that slows a shot down where it moves too
fast for the model, draws it again and puts it back on the clock (#76).** H3
smears bursty motion — a flip, a sword arc, a whip-fast turn — because one
latent time token spans four frames and cannot hold four different poses;
re-denoising does not help, the poses were never drawn. matlowai's Motion Lab
worked out the test-time answer and this is a clean reimplementation of its
core: after the pass is written, the jerk profile (the third difference of the
latent over time, per token) says where it ran too hot, those frames are held
on a longer 17k+5 clock at up to four copies each with the bridge and ramp
rules the method measured, the slowed clip is encoded and sampled again from
half the schedule against the shot's own prompt and references, and the
original clock is recovered by keeping the first frame of every hold group —
generated pixels, never interpolated. Five frames at either end are never
held, are frozen through the second pass and are put back verbatim, so the
fix cannot become a seam step of its own; a calm pass (peak motion under the
gate) is left alone and says so in the history; the soundtrack rides through
untouched. A blended seam off a fixed pass takes the frames road, and the
face pass, where on, runs over the fixed frames. The chip sits on the card
beside the face chip, and on a lone shot the same switch is a pill on its
row beside faces, only on H3 and never on footage; the dials are the
method's defaults in `families/h3/derope.py`, which is pure numpy and tested
without a model. Measured on a 2 s turbo card: a spinning kick gets its
shin, foot and face back with the choreography kept, at about twice the
card's own sampling time. The gate turned out to matter more than the dials:
the method's profile contrast read a static fern *higher* than the kick, and
forced through the pass the fern came back sharper and moving unnaturally,
so the gate reads peak frame-to-frame motion off the delivered frames
instead (4.4 on the kick, 1.9 on the fern, gate at 2.5). The line is on the
settings page under Rendering as four rows named by what they let through,
with the two measured clips as the anchors, and in the file as
`motion_fix_abstain`. Both comparisons are in `docs/timeline.md`.

**One picture editor — crop, turn, mirror, cut out — behind a pen on every
picture and clip (#75).** A window dragged over the part of the picture that
is the reference, with corner and edge handles, a lock to the shot's shape
(or square, 16:9, 9:16), a quarter turn each way, a mirror on either axis,
and on a still the scissors: cut out on or off, the SAM clicks (keep,
shift-click to drop) made on the same window, and the cutout previewed
inside it. A clip gets a transport to check the window across its segment.
The pen opens it from a chip's face, a picker cell, a clip card and the
pre-stage's chips alike — the chip scissors, the subject view and the
crop/cut/subject links on the card are gone, as is every reason a swap or a
keyframe pick used to open a poorer editor: the picker always carries a plate
spec, and where a family names no matte weights the server uses the BiRefNet
and SAM 3 the install has. Nothing is written to disk for a framing: it is a
`crop` blob on the asset — fractions of the picture as shown, after the turn
and the mirror — parsed and applied by one module (`creator/crop.py`)
wherever the file is read: `media.load_image` and `load_video`, the ffmpeg
graph a clip card is spliced through, the guide reader, plate panels, the
RefMod encoder, and core's own rotate, flip and crop nodes on the still
families' graphs. Thumbnails come framed off the thumb route, the adaptive
canvas follows the window rather than the file, the reference cache keys on
it, and a saved reference refuses one, since it was encoded before any window
could be drawn.

**Fixed: `{day|night}` groups in the Timeline window's standing prompt came
up as plain text (#74).** The window fills that box and then mounts, and a
highlight range added while the text is detached is one Chromium never
paints — it builds the markers when the range is added and nothing asks it
to look again when the node lands in the document — so the braces and the
fade sat unpainted until a keystroke re-added them. A box that is not in the
document now waits for its first layout and paints then. Firefox painted it
either way.

**SLA sparse attention is the fourth position on the attention pill (#23).**
PlagueKind's `H3 SLA Attention` scores each query block against every key
block once and attends only the best fraction — fewer keys rather than a
cheaper kernel, and the inference path the lightx2v SLA turbo LoRA was
distilled against, so it is at its best with that LoRA on the stack. It rides
`optimized_attention_override` the way core's kitchen kernel does, which is why
it is a position on the one switch and not a switch of its own; the node is
built at the pack's own tuning (its two required numbers read off the class,
the dozen optional ones left to the pack's defaults), and it needs Triton, so
the pack registers it only where it can run. Refused under VDN-H3 — the
port's windows run exact attention and hand the override only to the text
refiner, so there would be nothing to sparsify — and on Raylight, where no
model patch reaches the workers. Wired, not measured: the pack's own numbers
(1.4–1.75× at 768p/15 s on a 5090, with the LoRA) are the only ones so far.

**The Gallery has an Open folder button (#23).** Beside Organize, it shows
the folder being browsed — the output root, the input root, or the shelf you
are on — in the file manager of the machine ComfyUI runs on, which is asked
of `folder_paths` rather than assumed, so an install started with
`--output-directory` opens the folder it writes to. That machine is not
always the one the browser is on: on a remote install nothing comes up, the
foot says so, and the path is the caption either way. A route,
`/continuity/reveal`, refuses anything but those two roots.

**Style cards take a star (#23).** The Style tab had none because the
catalogue is shipped and a shipped row has nowhere to keep one. The star
lives beside the catalogue instead — one small file of ids, per ComfyUI user
like the preset index — merged onto the rows as they are drawn, so the star
sits where it sits on every other card, and the tab has the *★ Starred*
shelf the other tabs have. Counted under *Styles* on the stored-data page and
cleared with them.

**The cast shelf is one shelf, on every face.** The simple fullscreen view
hid it and the Cast tool outright, on the argument that casting is the `@`
menu and removing somebody is deleting their chip — but a deleted chip keeps
the member (#52), so somebody could sit in the piece with nothing on screen
to say so, and the `@` menu then stopped offering the library's copy of them
without saying why. Now the shelf is drawn on the node face, the desk, the
simple view, the pre-stage's H3 branch and the editor sheet alike; the
simple view starts it folded, and the rail's Cast tool is the switch — it no
longer casts a blank `@subject` on every press — and wears the head count
while the shelf is folded. A card in the Timeline window draws none of its
own: a name pressed there opens the member on the window's shelf. The `@`
menu's cast group is *In this piece*, and a member the sentence does not
write yet says so on their row. A file taken off the pool or a shot's row is
taken off every member built out of it, actions included — the face's sweep
predated actions becoming a list and left a removed clip claimed, and the
pool's ✕ released nothing — and a name typed over and left empty goes back
to what it was rather than leaving a member the menu cannot list.

**The seed pill catches up with the queue (#73).** On *increment*,
*decrement* and *randomize* the frontend moves the seed after the prompt is
serialized, inside the queue call; the pill redrew on serialization and so
showed the seed the last queue *sent*, one behind the number the node held,
until something unrelated redrew the row. The queue redraws it now.

**A shot can be shown a storyboard of the shots before it (#43).** A
*Storyboard* pill on the timeline's bar: *each shot sees the shot before it*,
or *the piece so far*. Every shot after the first is then handed a 3 × 3 sheet
of frames from those shots — nine cells shared out by how long each plays, in
time order, left to right, top to bottom — as its last picture reference,
with a line in the prompt saying what it is and how it reads. Made at render
time off the passes as delivered, so it is the shots as they actually came
out, a kept take included; a cut-in clip fills its cells from its file. The
chip on every seam says what its own card sees — *sees #1–3*, *no
storyboard* — and opens to the three answers plus a row of toggles for any
set of earlier shots, over a picture of the sheet with the number of the
shot each cell will come from. A shot shown one runs on the reference
checkpoint whatever else it carries, and re-renders when the shots it sees
change; the sheet is one of H3's nine pictures, and a full card is refused
by name. H3 only for now: LTX 2.5 lays every reference onto one sheet
already, and what a sheet of frames means inside that one is undecided.
Measured on two scenes at three and eight shots, turbo and base weights: the
place and its objects hold across every hard cut — the same boat in all
eight shots where the same description alone gave a different one in nearly
every shot — and the seam step is unchanged. The cost is that the sheet
holds the camera as firmly as the room, so a shot that needs a new angle
should be shown nothing on its seam chip. A pooled RefMod form was built,
measured worse (colour stains compounding down the chain) and reverted.

**A cast member's plate can wake on a word (#72).** Each file on a member has
a second line under "what it shows of them": the words it wakes on. Blank,
the file comes with them into every shot that names them, as before. `hat,
cap` on the plate of the red hat, and it is in a shot only while the sentence
says one of those words — matched at the start of a word, so `smok` on a
smoking sheet answers "smoking" and "smokes" while "what" leaves the hat
alone. A character with thirty plates is then
written as a sentence: "@vera, in her hat, lights a cigarette" brings the
face, the hat and the smoking sheet and leaves the rest out, under the cap.
Decided after `{a|b}` has chosen, so a word inside an alternative the seed
passes over wakes nothing; a file the sentence names outright is awake
whatever its words; a muted file stays muted. The card's chip says *wakes on
hat, cap* behind a ring — filled while the file is in, hollow while it waits
— and carries the owner's words for the file too, which is how img-4 and
img-5 tell apart. The sentence says why: the word that woke a plate is
underlined in the member's hue, every time it occurs, except inside an
alternative the seed passes over. A member every one of whose plates is asleep, with no words
of their own, is refused by name with the words that would wake one. The
words are kept in the cast library and follow a picture onto its RefMod.

**Their actions are a list.** A member's "their action comes from this" held
one file, so hanging the smoking sheet evicted the golf swing. It is a list
now, like their looks and the place they take — the definition reads "whose
motion comes from Video 1 (the swing) and Picture 3 (the left hand)" — and
each action can wake on its own words. Old blobs with one handle read as the
one-element list they meant (#72).

**Deleting somebody's name mutes their pictures.** Casting a member attaches
their files to the shot, and compile already left an uncited member's files
out of the render — but the reference row went on showing them live, so a
picture the model was never going to see sat there looking sent. Now the
sole claims of a member whose last mention goes are muted (dimmed, kept, one
press or one written-back name from live), which is what the row said about
a reference deleted by handle all along. The member stays on the shelf, as
before (#52).

**A cast file's chip says whose it is.** Casting somebody attaches their
files, and the reference row marked those with a rule down the edge — which,
beside their name in the sentence, read as a second picture of them attached
twice. A RefMod most of all: its thumbnail is decoded from its latent and
looks exactly like the photo it was made of. Now the chip says *Veranul's
RefMod* (or *Veranul's*, for a picture) in Veranul's own hue, the rule wears
that hue too, and the words open them. A mod nobody is built out of says
*RefMod*. Nothing is sent twice — the chip is the file the render reads.

**Saved looks can be re-encoded in the other mode.** A compressed mod that
stained, or a full one costing more than a shot can carry, used to mean taking
the member off the cast, attaching the picture again and saving again. The
ledger on their page — the shelf's and the library's — offers *Re-encode ▾*,
and so does each mod's own row menu under *Encoded as*: compressed or full,
from the picture the file was made of, which the header names from now on
(the full picker path, not the basename). The file keeps its name, so the member's looks
and every citation stay put. A full mod whose picture has left the input
folder is still compressed from its own latent; it cannot be made full again,
and the row says so. Stacks are not remade — save the member again.

**Cast members can be saved as RefMods, and RefMods have a home.** A ledger
under a member's tiles says what their looks cost a render — *2 pictures + 1
clip at max · ≈8,200+ tokens* — and offers *Save as RefMod*: one stacked file
(every still and clip pooled to a 16×16 grid, end to end as one video mod —
the shape of ComfyUI-MiniMaxH3Mod's own `vanellope_example`, motion included,
cited as one `<Video n>`), or per picture, compressed (pooled to a 48-grid,
a few hundred tokens — measured against the picture itself: the sibling
pack's 16-grid stains a face, 48 renders like the full encode) or full (the
encode at a 1024 short edge). The mods are that pack's `.safetensors`
format, in `models/refmods/cast/`; they land where the sources were, the
member's looks point at them, and the sources leave the piece unless somebody
else still needs them. Saved, the ledger is the receipt —
mode, tokens, path — with *Download* beside it. Importing a `.safetensors` — on the Cast
tab or the picker's RefMod tab — makes the member: one named after the file
appears at once and their page opens, Cast button at its foot. The Cast
tab grows a *Saved references* column: every mod on the machine, what it
costs, who is built out of it; a stray one becomes a member from there, hangs
on an existing one, is renamed (members follow), described in its header, or
deleted. A member's page lists their
files as rows with how each is encoded, and the shut line on the shelf shows
the cost. The star and the swap on a card's header are now *Keep in library*
and *Recast from library* in a footer. Five routes carry the files:
`/continuity/refmod/{file,upload,move,delete,describe}`. Nothing about a mod is
a concept extractor and the docs say so; audio mods are refused (#53).

**The VDN-H3 pill throws turbo with it, at the stage's own numbers.** Before,
the pill only picked the stage: the sampler row stayed at twenty res_multistep
steps, and the turbo switch — if thrown — landed on its own quality's count,
six by default, under a distill adapter trained for eight. Now the `vdn` block
of the family's turbo declaration owns the row whenever the stage is on: 8
steps, er_sde + beta (the port's example workflow) on the checkpoints' own
shifts, whatever file the switch holds, since the file is off the run anyway.
The pill going on throws the switch — with no file and no merged claim it
engages for the stage's sake and is released when the pill goes off; with a
file it is re-thrown to the file's row instead. The quality stops are not drawn
under VDN, a DMD stage having one count.

**VDN-H3 on the sampler row.** A pill picks a Video Delta Net stage from
`models/vdn` and the shot samples through OpenVDN's hybrid attention: nearby
frames keep exact softmax attention inside a window, everything further away
goes through a linear-attention branch whose cost is constant in clip length,
and two adapters ride on the same H3 checkpoints you already have. The port
that runs it — Saganaki22's ComfyUI-VDN-H3, Apache-2.0 — travels with the pack
the way the LoRA stack and the DLSS port do (`creator/vdnh3/`, re-synced by
`tools/vendor_vdnh3.py`), so there is nothing to install beyond the stage; the
stage list is asked of the server when the pill opens, so a download after
boot is offered without a restart. One knob, the stage: the adapters merge,
the branch weights are placed by free VRAM and the softmax runs grouped, which
is what upstream validated the release on.
It is for long shots. Under about fifteen latent frames the window covers the
whole clip and the port falls back to dense attention, so a strip of
two-second cards pays for the adapters and gains nothing, and every step is
dearer than the int8 attention routes; a strip of fifteen-second shots is
where it pays. The stage's `turbo` adapter is the 8-step distillation and it
replaces the community turbo LoRAs rather than stacking on them, so it follows
the row's turbo switch: on, the distill file the switch engaged is left out of
every stack for the run, and the turbo lead-in holds the adapter off for its
opening steps the way it held the file off. The VDN patch goes on first,
innermost, since it owns each block's attention forward; sage attention
patches the same key and the pair is refused by name, while kitchen attention,
the caches, Spectrum and the chunked feed-forward compose. Refused on a
Raylight render like every other patch on this side of the wire. Nothing has
been rendered with it from this pack yet: the graph is tested, the vendored
math is tested against upstream's fold, and the first fifteen-second segment
at both resolutions is the next thing to measure.

**`{day|night}` in a prompt is a choice the seed makes.** Braces holding
alternatives separated by bars turn one prompt into many videos: every render
picks one alternative from each group, the same seed picks the same ones, and
rolling the seed asks for a new combination. Groups nest, an alternative may
be empty, and `{@anna|@ben}` casts whoever is picked with only their files —
a reference named only inside the alternative the seed passed over is muted
for that render, and its chip on the row greys with the name in the sentence,
because everything live on the row is encoded whether the prompt names it or
not.
The choice is made on the piece before a request exists, so a card with no
group keeps the cache entry it had, and each card on a strip chooses on its
own seed and number while the global prompt chooses once for the piece. The
prompt box lights the alternative the current seed will take and fades the
rest, in the sentence itself, and "What the model reads" shows the finished
prompt with the choice made. Refine is told to keep every group and may grow
the alternatives; a rewrite that settled a choice on its own is reported under
the panel the way a dropped quote is (issue #69, asked for by @G0Thommy).

**The words on a cast member's file survive changing what it lends them.**
The tile's menu takes a sentence about the file and is also where the file
is switched from their looks to their action, and the switch threw the
sentence away: it cleared the old slot before filling the new one, and the
clear drops a file's words the moment it is on none of their slots. The move
now fills first and clears second, so a file changing slots is never off
them (issue #70, reported by @pvhrip).

**A strip that opens on footage or a held take no longer renders its later
parts one size too small under "direct".** The timeline pins every part to
one canvas, and when part 1 was a clip or a held take, or the ratio pill was
forced, that pin was resolved at the first-pass edge on the assumption that
a refine pass would carry it up to the slider. Under "direct" nothing does,
so an 864 slider gave an 864 first part and 768 for the rest, and the save
node refused the reel after all of it had sampled (issue #15, found on the
two-GPU path, where two-pass is refused and direct is the only way past
native). The pin now resolves at the edge the first pass actually samples
at. And the size check runs before a node is built: a strip whose parts
would not match is refused in the same breath as every other pre-queue
refusal, naming both parts, instead of ten minutes and a discarded render
later. Reported with a precise repro by @ofung30-sketch.

**The turbo lead-in is on by default, at four steps.** It shipped off,
because nobody had measured it. It has been now: on an 8-hop turbo strip the
brightness step at every cut goes from +2.86 with it off to +1.74 at three
steps and +0.98 at four, the texture ratchet falls with it, and it is the
one lever found that reduces the drift rather than trading it for something
else (issue #41). The cost is four of the schedule's steps at the base
weights' speed. The settings rows now offer off, two and four, and the
timeline doc has a section on seams and drift that says what each lever was
measured to do.

**A fourth seam road: the latent, masked.** The three roads so far all hand
the inherited run to the model as pinned guides over a fresh latent, and the
measured cost of that is a step at every hop. `seam_handoff: "masked"` writes
the run sliced off the source pass's latent into the next pass's own first
steps and holds them there with core's noise mask, so the model continues the
tokens it made rather than generating new ones under guidance — the mechanism
ComfyUI added for H3 in August, and the one the pack linked from issue #50
chains with. Picture only: the seam's sound still crosses as a reference
block, since a 22-frame feather does not land on the 40 Hz audio grid.
Measured on an 8-hop turbo strip: the brightness step at each cut goes from
+2.86 on the latent road to -0.11, end to end from +24 to under +2, and each
pass samples in about half the time because no guide tokens ride in the
sequence. Under a turbo lead-in it first measured worse (+6.5): core hands
the first sitting's latent on scaled for its leftover noise, and the inpaint
path injected the protected run at that scale. A hold between the two
sittings now puts the run back under its mask; that path is built from the
diagnosis and not yet measured. Off by default. Where the run does not fit
the canvas, the seam falls back to the guides as the latent road does.

**A LoRA's soundtrack slider is saved, "action" sticks, and deleting a name
no longer deletes the cast.** Three losses from issue #52. The soundtrack
dial on a LoRA was never written into the piece, so a clone or a reload put
every one back to full — and the backend only ever saw full. Picking "action"
for a reference set it to "full": the menu showed the word "action" for the
stored value "motion", and the pick was matched back against the wrong word.
And deleting a cast member's name out of a prompt took the member off the
shelf and the pictures casting them attached off the piece, which a rewrite
of scene 1 did to the whole cast at once. A member now stays until the
shelf's ✕ says otherwise; an uncited member costs nothing at queue time.
Removing the one card a cast's pictures sit on hands them to the pool first
instead of taking them with the card.

**Kitchen attention reads core's V3 option list again.** ComfyUI moved
`ModelAttentionBackend` to the V3 API on 2026-09-08, and its `INPUT_TYPES`
shim now leads with the type name rather than the choices. The pack read that
string as the option list, refused a kitchen kernel the machine had, and said
so as `['C', 'O', 'M', 'B', 'O']`. Both shapes are read now (issue #64).
Reported and patched by @sarnara2.

**Sixteen fixes off one audit (issue #54), the DLSS switch first.** In a
Timeline body the DLSS pill's popover threw before it mounted — the body has no
`geometry()`, the modal does — so a piece saved with the pass on could not turn
it off, and rendering without the weights died after the sampler had finished.
Fixed at the callback. With it: a reel of nothing but held takes passes through
the neural node instead of being refused; a video reference set to `match` no
longer serialises away and comes back as `max` after a merge or a pool
injection; merged sheets allocate owner and panel handles in one namespace, so
`plate-1`'s `img-1` panel stops colliding with the sheet renamed onto `img-1`;
the H3 segment's fingerprint calls `timeline.stamps` again, which a bare except
had been hiding since the family move. The tool benches keep the frame on
screen at a VFR trim mark rather than the next one decoded, keep the trimmed
tail's duration, and place a clip's sound by its own timestamps — internal
gaps and an initial delay included — through a reader the reel's mux now
shares. The standalone neural node keeps every pixel under a zero mask: the
detail filter used to smear the masked residual past its edge. A Blockout run
freezes camera marks, pass, duration and prose at the press, not only the
objects. The loupe accepts only its producer's output as the twin — every save
node now stamps `continuity_producer` into the file — queues just that
producer's closure, and follows seeks, playback and dial changes without
marking a stale tile current. Takes land on the card that queued them by a
persistent `card_id` rather than by content, so deleting one of two identical
cards no longer hands the survivor the other's take, and two overlapping
submissions keep their own snapshots. Natural's detail dial resets to
Natural's default; the settings page counts remembered folders and layouts
among what it offers to clear. A restored seam on the frames road hands over
restored frames only, no latent, as the setting says. The drift-guard findings in the same audit
(items 6, 7, E4) landed after the guard was already removed. Reported, with
patches, by @sarnara2.

**Better DLSS 5 defaults: each style preset now opens at its own detail
strength, with colour off.** The DLSS 5 pass shipped opening at the model's own
answer, 1 on both strengths, which is right for detail and wrong for colour:
that half is a grade, and at 1 it darkened skin, flattened knitwear and muddied
brick on every still it was measured against. Every preset opens at colour 0 —
`standard` and `cinematic` at detail 1.25, `natural` at 1 — and switching preset
carries the new one's strengths onto the dials you have not moved yourself.
Detail stops at 4 rather than 8, where the pass had begun putting blue-orange
fringes on lit edges, which also settles a dial that read one range in the
popover and another on the bench. `neutral` is documented for what it is:
upstream switches the model's local tone and structure off there, so no strength
does anything.

**A zoom and pan viewer for finished renders, with a before/after wipe.**
Double-clicking a render opened the browser's own fullscreen: a banner across
the top of the screen in Firefox, the picture fitted to the display and
impossible to look into, and nowhere to put a comparison. There is a room for it
now — wheel to zoom about the pointer, drag to pan, double-click between fit and
1:1, Escape to leave — and it carries the seam the upscale bench used to have to
itself. It opens from the stage, from a take on the fullscreen lip, from the
upscale bench's result, and from the refiner pill's own *See what it does*.

**Before/after compare re-renders the shot with the refiner switched off,
instead of refining the output twice.** A finished file carries the prompt that
made it, and the DLSS 5 refiner is one boolean in that prompt's blob — so the
honest other half of the seam is that render with the boolean moved, and it is
nearly free: ComfyUI keys an expanding node's subcache by its id rather than by
its inputs, so the twin re-expands the node and hits every sampler underneath
it. What runs is the pass and the save. The viewer offers *Render it without the
refiner* on a render made with one and *Render it with the refiner* on one made
without, puts the file that comes back on the other side of the wipe at full
frame, and leaves it on the shelf as the ordinary take it is. Only where there
is no render to re-queue — a photograph, footage, somebody else's file — does it
fall back to running the pass on the square you are looking at. The upscale
bench says the same thing where it matters: a source that was already refined
now says so before its *Refine (DLSS 5)* entry is read as a before-and-after.

**The DLSS 5 controls are sliders now, with saved setups you can name and
reuse.** The DLSS 5 popover was a radio pair, three steppers and a paragraph —
`detail` runs 0 to 8 in quarters, which is thirty-two presses end to end, with
the picture it changes nowhere on screen. It is a switch and a column of sliders
now, the same dials the bench and the viewer draw, each one back to its default
on a double-click. Under them: a shelf of **saved setups**, per machine, and
*Start here*, which is what a piece's refiner begins at the first time it is
switched on. The two benches' remembered checkpoints are kept now too — they
were being written to a settings file that had never had a home for them.

**Fixed: the upscale bench read the source size off a 320-pixel thumbnail, so
its preview area, size readout and memory estimate were all wrong.** It took a
source's size off the thumbnail in its own locator, which `/continuity/thumb`
caps at 320 pixels. So on a 1080p still the locator's square covered more than
half the frame while the glass showed a fifth of it, the size under the glass
was not the file's, and the refiner's memory estimate was out by the square of
the ratio. The size comes off the file's header now, for a picture exactly as
for a clip, and the square is drawn from the same arithmetic the server cuts
with (`web/creator/tile.js`, mirrored in `tests/test_bench.py`). How much of the
picture is on the glass is a control as well: the wheel over the locator opens
the square out to 1024 source pixels or closes it to 128.

**DLSS 5 neural refiner support, for stills and clips.** NVIDIA's DLSS 5 neural
renderer — the material network, not the upscaler — as a pass over finished
stills and clips, through the open-source MLX-DLSS port's PyTorch backend. Skin,
hair, fabric, contact shadows and subsurface are re-drawn at the size the
picture already is. A `DLSS 5` pill on the pre-stage, Creator and Timeline
sampler rows; a *Refine (DLSS 5)* entry on the upscale bench with a *Then
refine* switch on Sharpen and Restore; a *Continuity Neural Refine* node for any
IMAGE, with a MASK socket that drives where it refines. A clip is refined after
the whole reel with the previous frame reprojected into the next, so it does not
boil, and after ReDetail where that is on. Every surface prints the memory it
will want — about a gigabyte per megapixel, squared by the processing scale —
before it runs. Nothing of NVIDIA's ships with the pack: the port's inference
and extraction code is vendored (Apache-2.0, pinned, `tools/vendor_mlxdlss.py`),
and the weights are extracted, on the settings page, from the user's own DLSS
DLL after a hash check. Without them the pack loads and renders exactly as
before, and the pills say what is missing.

**A seam can continue from the model's own latent instead of a VAE round trip
(#41, #46).** The run a seam inherits used to be read off the source pass's
decode and encoded again; measured on H3, that trip darkens the run by about
1.3/255 and hardens its contrast by about half a percent, in the same direction
every time, and since every seam re-encodes a tail that was itself decoded from
the pass before, it walked down a strip. The segment node now takes the source
pass's sampler latent beside its frames and slices the run off that, in phase on
the same grid; a restored seam hands over the restore's own latent. The frames
still travel for the text encoder's boundary picture, and a seam whose source
was face-passed, trimmed at its tail, or finished at another canvas reads them
as before. The settings page's "Seam handoff" row offers the three roads: the
frames, the latent, and the latent *levelled* — the same slice pulled back to
the first pass's channel mean and spread before the model reads it. Measured on
an eight-shot strip, the picture brightened about 1.5/255 per pass on raw H3 and
twice that under a turbo LoRA, and the plain latent handoff changed none of it:
the drift is the model continuing from its own output and adding its bias again.
Levelling breaks the stacking at the conditioning, so each pass drifts within
itself and the next starts where the first did; the finished frames are
untouched. Issues #41, #46.

**Fixed: music over a first shot was dropped because the audio encoder was never
wired in (#47).** A sound-lane block over a pass with no seam and no reference
audio is still an encode — the cue is written into the audio latent through the
audio VAE — but the predicate that wires the VAE in did not count it, so a first
shot with a cue and nothing else with sound in it reached the fill with no
encoder at all. The lane counts now. Issue #47.

**Fixed: a take could land on the wrong card when the strip was edited
mid-render (#47).** The save node names a take by the card's number as it was
queued, and the strip stays editable while a render runs, so a card moved or
removed meanwhile put its take on whoever slid under the number — stamped so
that the "edited since" mark stayed quiet. The strip is snapshotted as it is
queued and a take is matched to the card object, or by its stamp where the body
was rebuilt; a removed card's take stays in the history rather than going to a
neighbour. A card edited while its own render ran is marked afterwards, which it
never was. Issue #47.

**Fixed: sound cues placed over supplied footage were silently dropped (#47).**
The lane's tooltip said sound over a clip is mixed, and the compiler dropped it
on the strength of a comment saying the muxer read the lane itself, which it
never did. The blocks now ride on the clip's own spec and the writer mixes them
from their files, at the frame the lane put them, under whatever sound the clip
plays with; a muted clip is silence under the cue. A cue dragged over a clip
re-runs that clip's reel node, which decodes nothing, and no pass. Issue #47.

**Fixed: trimming supplied footage could come out short, and drop the frame
showing at the trim's start (#47).** The shared decoder dropped every frame
before a window's start — including the one still showing when it opened — and
stopped at the last frame captured inside it rather than at the window's end. On
constant-rate footage nothing visible; on a screen recording that holds a frame
for seconds, a trim opened on the next frame and came out short of the seconds
the strip was told it plays, and the seam beside it found too few frames and
refused the blend. The frame showing at the start is pushed first and the last
frame is held to the window's end, bounded by the file's own. Issue #47.

**Fixed: a clip whose audio starts late had its sound pulled to the front
(#47).** A soundtrack whose first packet sits a second in was laid at the
window's start, a second early, with the missing second padded onto the end. It
stays where the file had it. Issue #47.

**Fixed: a guide trimmed to a cut held a frame from past the trim (#47).** The
two frames of decoder slack past the trim's end were decoded and the last of
them held for the rest of the shot — the next scene, on a trim that ends on a
cut. The trim is enforced before anything is held. Issue #47.

**Fixed: a merged pass lost its plate's panels, its guide's tracing op and its
audio tail (#47).** The merged request's asset list was written back without a
plate's panels — the handles the joined prompt cites, so the merged pass refused
its own prompt — and without a guide's tracing op, so a matte guide went down
the ordinary control-video path instead of the inpaint one. The unblended sound
seam's tail fell back to the default on a merged pass too. All four are kept.
Issue #47.

**Fixed: the aspect source pointed at the wrong card after a move, copy or
removal (#47).** The piece's aspect source names a card by number, and the
number stayed put through a move, a copy or a removal in front of it while the
seams' sources were remapped — the canvas quietly took the shape of whatever
card slid under the number. It follows the card now, and is dropped with it. On
a render that holds cards back, the donor is found by the number it wears on the
strip rather than by its position in the shorter list, and a donor held out with
nothing to play is refused by name. Issue #47.

**Fixed: a tool could wait forever for a job that finished before its listener
was armed (#47).** The plate, refine, control and upscale tools posted their job
and only then listened for its result, while the server queues the job before it
answers — so a job that finished inside the round trip had answered nobody and
the tool waited forever. The listener is armed first and what arrived meanwhile
is replayed. Issue #47.

**Fixed: the upscale bench and the refiners ignored a picture's or clip's
rotation (#47).** The bench's video frame came off the decoder unturned, so a
phone clip's preview and the still it exports lay on their side while the reel,
the seams and the guides had been put upright; and the refiners were handed a
photo without its orientation tag applied while the thumbnail beside it had
been. Both turned. Issue #47.

**Fixed: a plate re-cut under a different matte model returned the first model's
file (#47).** A sheet accepted under one matte model and re-accepted under
another with the same pictures found the first file and returned it before
consulting the model. The model is part of the name where a panel is cut, and an
uncut sheet keeps the name it had. Issue #47.

**Fixed: replacing a sound file under the same name was a cache hit, so the old
audio was reused (#47).** The lane's cues were the one kind of file a render
reads that its cache stamps did not walk, so swapping the file's contents under
the same name was a cache hit — on the piece's fingerprint and on the segment's.
Both walk the lane now. Issue #47.

**Fixed: portrait phone clips played on their side in renders, seams, references
and guides.** A portrait phone recording is stored landscape with a turn written
in the container. The reel spliced the storage picture, so the clip lay on its
side in the finished file; the seam beside it inherited the same sideways
frames; and the three places that swapped a clip's width and height for the turn
were reading a stream attribute PyAV does not have, so they never did. The turn
now comes off the first decoded frame, where PyAV actually puts it, and the
shared decoder makes it with ffmpeg's own transposes before the crop, so the
reel, the seams, the references, the guides and the bench cut all agree with the
player.

**Fixed: thumbnails ignored a photo's orientation tag, so phone photos showed
sideways.** A picture's thumbnail was core's `/view?preview=` re-encode, which
saves without the orientation tag, so a phone photo stored sideways came back
sideways in every cell beside a full picture the browser had turned upright.
Stills come through the pack's own thumb route now, with the tag applied,
downscaled, and as webp so transparency survives; a clip's still is turned the
same way.

**Fixed: a seam beside variable-rate footage read the wrong frames, or too few
to blend (#46).** The frames a generation inherited from a clip were read
through core's video decoder and resampled to 24 fps by the stream's average
rate, while the clip itself was spliced into the finished file by timestamp
through ffmpeg's `fps` filter. On constant-rate footage the two agree; on
variable-rate footage — a phone, a screen recording — the average describes none
of the frames, so the seam read the wrong ones, or too few of them and refused
the blend. Both now read through one decoder, so the run handed to the sampler
is the run the file plays before the cut, and a guide clip is read by timestamp
the same way. Issue #46.

**Fixed: the timeline strip could shrink below its cards and grow a second
scrollbar (#46).** The timeline modal's body is a column that scrolls, and the
strip in it was allowed to shrink before the body did — so on a short window it
came up shorter than its own cards, and since a horizontal scroller clips on the
vertical too, that was a second scrollbar down the side of the strip with each
card's buttons under it, the ✕ among them. The strip keeps its height now and
the body scrolls; there is one scrollbar. Issue #46.

**Removing a card now asks for confirmation (#46).** The ✕ on a card was one
press away from the one thing in the strip that cannot be undone. It now turns
into "Really remove?" on the first press and removes on the second; the pointer
leaving the card puts the ✕ back. The library's Delete has always worked this
way. Issue #46.

**Fixed: a crowded reel band dropped some shot numbers instead of numbering
along the edge (#46).** On the node's band a short shot beside long ones gave up
its number while the others kept theirs, and three short opening shots on a
seventeen- shot piece read as "3 4 5 …" with something cut off before it. A band
that cannot number every cell now numbers none of them and counts along the edge
instead, the way a band too narrow for any label already did. Issue #46.

**Fixed: reasoning models on the OpenAI refiner route returned an empty reply.**
A thinking model on the OpenAI route spent the whole reply budget on its trace
and returned no content, which the panel reported as a server that returned
nothing. The request now carries `reasoning_effort: none`, shed like any other
parameter where a provider rejects it, and a reply that is empty beside a
reasoning trace says so, with the tokens it burned — Ollama's Qwen3-VL builds
reason whatever they are told, and the fix there is a larger reply length.

**Fixed: on a piece with a cast, the built-in refiner rewrote every card as the
example name and invented picture citations.** On a piece with a cast the
built-in refiner asked a small model for two things at once: the six-section
reference form, whose worked example defines `<Subject 1>` from a picture, and a
note saying to define nothing and write the name — with `@anna` as its example,
one line above the real names. A 4B model copied the example: every rewrite was
about Anna, and the pictures were cited by their file handles, invented, or
dropped. Now the cast's own names are written into the note, the reference
template and the contract with a cast ask for the summary and the bodies alone,
a member's picture is listed under the member as "[image N]" and nowhere else,
and every card in a cast piece is refined as a reference request with every
member's name accepted — a card that says only "she" comes back saying `@juno`.

**Cast files can carry a description and an encoding size, and a still can lend
its pose.** Every tile on a cast card opens a menu with a line at its head for
what that file shows of them - "her face, front-lit", "the golf swing" - written
after the file's label in the subject definition, and the size it is encoded at
under the roles. Both are kept with the member in the cast library. A still can
now lend its pose the way a clip lends its movement, and a subject whose motion
is borrowed gets a retention clause saying the movement is followed, which
nothing wrote before. On screen that role is now called *action* — the chip, the
role and the facts line — while the stored value and the prompt keep the guide's
word, motion.

**A seam can restore the frames it hands over, so a long strip stops going soft
(#41).** (#41). Every continued shot comes out a little softer than the one it
continues, and because the next seam anchors on that tail the loss compounds
down a strip — the model's own bias when it continues from its own output, which
no arrangement of the handoff cures. The seam popover now has a restore switch:
the run the seam inherits is re-noised partway down the schedule and re-drawn
against the source shot's own references and prompt, at the same canvas, and
*that* is what the next shot continues from. One short generation per seam, H3
only, between two generated shots, off by default. Three strengths; start with
Medium.

**Takes are written as each pass lands, so a failed strip keeps the passes that
worked (#41).** (#41). A strip that failed on its last pass used to keep nothing
— fourteen good passes and every one sampled again. Each generated pass now
writes its own take the moment it exists, and the strip picks them up mid-render
and after a failure alike. A quality change also re-muxes the takes from the
cached passes instead of sampling anything.

**Type-to-find in every long picker: checkpoints, VAEs, encoders, LoRAs,
upscalers and samplers.** A list of eight or more — every checkpoint, VAE,
encoder, LoRA and upscaler picker, and the sampler lists — opens with a find
line where its title was. Typing narrows the list as you go, each word of the
query has to appear somewhere in the name, and what it found is underlined in
the name. Enter takes the first match, the arrows move between them, Escape
clears the query before it closes the list. Short lists are drawn as they always
were.

**The turbo LoRA picker opens instantly instead of scanning the whole folder
first (#41).** (#41). It used to fetch the whole LoRA listing — a stat per file
and a sidecar read per row — before it would open, which on a fresh start of a
large folder was minutes of a pill that did nothing when pressed. It now lists
names alone off their own route, says "Scanning models/loras…" while that first
scan runs, and shows the list the moment it lands. The names are no longer
capped at the newest six hundred files either, so a distillation older than the
cap is offered again.

**Fixed: a failed LoRA fetch pinned the turbo picker to an empty list until
reload (#41).** (#41). A fetch that failed while ComfyUI was still loading used
to pin every turbo picker to an empty list until the page reloaded, and Rescan
could not reach it. Failure is no longer cached, the pickers retry on the next
press, and the manager's Rescan now clears this list too.

**Fixed: picking "No LoRA · merged checkpoint" left no way back to the turbo
picker (#41).** (#41). Picking it left the turbo pill with no way back into the
picker for that node's whole life. The re-pick control now shows in merged mode
too, and choosing between a file and merged is the same gesture everywhere.

**A third bench: Blockout — stage a scene in grey boxes, walk a camera through
it, and render a guide.** A scene staged out of grey boxes on a bare floor — or
one of five starting arrangements — a camera walked through it on marks, and a
guide rendered along the path: Depth, Blocks or Lines in the tracing bench's own
names, or As staged, the clay render itself as plain footage for the families
that read footage raw. It is an editor: pieces move, turn and size on three axes
by their handles or by the figures in the rail, with snapping. The shot camera
stands in the set as a frustum with its path drawn on the floor, and a second
camera flies around it — WASD, orbit, focus — without touching a thing that gets
written. The glass shows the stage or the pass, whole, on a switch, and the
frame's shape is picked from the pack's own aspect popover — the family's
ratios, not three of this bench's own — at that family's native canvas. The
renderer is a software rasterizer in the browser drawing at the frame's own
pixels; the server only encodes, off the render queue, and a still never touches
the server at all. The foot writes the move in the H3 spec's own camera
vocabulary, ready to paste into a prompt, and the scene rides beside the clip as
a sidecar.

**A blockout piece can play a cast member, and the bench writes the staging as
prompt text.** The bench writes the staging for you — who stands where in frame,
computed from its own projection — ahead of the camera move: *"@anna stands at
centre in the midground; a table at frame left. The camera pushes in toward
@anna at slow speed."* The handle is the prompt's own citation, so pasting the
prose binds the words to her references with no new machinery; the block wears
her chip hue on the stage side only. The sidecar gains each named piece's screen
box at every mark.

**H3 across two GPUs, through the Karmabu Raylight fork.** Picked in the weights
popover. Everything this pack does between a loader and a sampler is a patch on
a MODEL and a Ray render has none, so the refine, face and re-detail passes, the
turbo lead-in, blended sound seams, the accelerators, MultiGPU device pins and
the ControlNet guide all refuse on this path, each naming what to switch off.
LoRAs merge through ComfyUI's loader inside the workers, which is worse on the
quantized checkpoints; the switch says so.

**A piece that names no score now gets the guide's `N/A` instead of an empty
field.** H3 always emits a soundtrack, so an empty `non_diegetic_music` reads as
a free hand rather than as a decision. The description itself is never added to:
what you wrote about who speaks is the whole of what the model is told.

**A LoRA can be damped on the soundtrack, with its own dial on the card.** An
entry carries its own adaLN modality scales, drawn as a Soundtrack dial on the
card. It damps rather than mutes: attention is joint over the packed sequence.

**Six aspect shapes and a Wide/Tall switch, replacing the column of ratios
(#36).** (#36). 2:3, 3:2, 5:4 and 4:5 are there, without printing four
rectangles twice. The video envelope opens to 9:21..21:9 — the clamp is for
bounding a donor picture, not for vetoing a shape somebody picked.

**The shelf list now comes from the filesystem, so deleted folders stop being
offered.** Delete an input folder from a terminal and the picker no longer goes
on offering its contents. An empty shelf made by mistake can be removed.

**Settings lists everything the pack has stored about you, item by item, before
offering to remove it.** The preset library, this browser's stars and LoRA notes
and refiner choices, the reference cache, the refiner's server, the settings
themselves — each row reports what is actually there before it offers to remove
it. Nothing on it deletes a render, a reference or a workflow.

**Fixed: in Firefox, a sentence ending in a spoken line could not be typed past
or backspaced.** Firefox will not put a caret after a chip with no text node
beside it, so a sentence ending in dialogue could not be typed past, backspaced
or arrowed out of.

**Bench presses, refines and plates go on ComfyUI's own queue, so Cancel and the
progress bar work.** They ran in a thread pool beside `prompt_worker` rather
than behind it, so four of them could hold the one card at once. Cancel reaches
them now, `queue_remaining` counts them, and the progress bar is the real one —
which also fixes a cancelled render's stale sampler state reappearing under the
next bench press. Previews stay off the queue deliberately and are gated
instead.

**Support for the eight output heads in alibaba-pai's MiniMax-H3-Acc-LoRAs
(#34).** (#34). alibaba-pai's MiniMax-H3-Acc-LoRAs carry 32 output heads beside
the rank-64 trunk, one per interval of the flow grid; loaded as an ordinary LoRA
they fell out as passenger keys and the render just looked like a weak distill.
They ride as an object patch now, armed off each step's own sigmas.

## 3.0

**Quoted words in a prompt can become a spoken line, with a speaker, a language
and a delivery.** H3 reads speech in a form nobody writes by hand: a stable
speaker ID outside a `<d>` tag, the identity and the delivery outside it too,
and only a language tag and the words inside — with a voiceover carrying a fixed
phrase and a mandatory sentence saying the lips stay closed. Getting that right
was the refiner's job or nobody's. Closing a quote in the prompt box now opens a
small menu instead: **Spoken** writes the whole form around your words, and
**Written in the picture** writes nothing, because plain double quotes already
*are* section 4.5's syntax for a sign, a banner or a subtitle. Both answers are
the guide's, which is why the second one is a row and not a way out — a menu
that silently turned every quote into speech would be overwriting one grammar
with the other.

The menu reads what you already wrote. `@vera is saying "take this"` uses Vera
as the speaker and `saying` as the delivery and replaces both, so the line does
not end up saying who is speaking twice; a sentence that merely ends in a name —
`@vera looks at the sign reading` — keeps every word of itself, because only a
speech verb after a declared name counts. Behind the two rows sit three dials:
who says it, in which of the eleven languages H3 supports, and how — `says`,
`asks`, `replies`, `whispers`, `shouts`, `sings`, or an off-screen voiceover
whose two required halves are written for you. Speakers come from the piece's
cast, from the cast library, or from a description typed on the spot, which
joins the cast as a member with no files.

The line is drawn in the sentence as a rule down its left edge in the speaker's
own colour — dashed for a voiceover, because a voice in the room and a voice over
the picture are the same words and a different sound — and the delivery and the
language show only where they are not the ordinary answer. Pressing it reopens
the menu on it: the words themselves are editable, the speaker and language and
delivery can be changed, and **Written in the picture** becomes an undo that puts
the words back on screen. A lead-in the menu did not write is carried through
untouched.

The `(Sx)` numbers are not typed and never appear in the box. A line holds
`(S@vera)`, and the compiler resolves it in cast order to the guide's two-label
form, `<Subject 1> (S1)` — so reordering the cast renumbers the speakers exactly
as it already renumbers the subjects, and a literal ID cannot rot into pointing
at whoever used to be first. `subjects.speakers` now numbers anyone who speaks,
not only those with a voice reference bound to them, and a line by somebody
nobody cast is refused by name rather than compiled.

Two things fixed on the way. Every glyph in the `@` and `/` menus was drawn as a
solid blob — the menu floats on `<body>`, outside the three roots that set
`fill: none` — and the `/` menu's way back out of a branch could only ever be
taken with the left arrow, because pressing it blurred the box and dismissed the
menu under the press.

**Fixed: the second pass turned the soundtrack to static on renders above 768 px
(#33).** (#33). Rendering above the native 768 px edge runs two passes, and the
refine pass held its audio the wrong way: it handed the sampler a clean,
un-noised soundtrack part-way down the schedule and trusted it to ride through
untouched. It does not. H3 carries the audio stream on its own flow shift — the
model is told the sound is as noisy as the picture unless a mask says otherwise
— so it predicted a velocity for a stream with no noise in it and applied that
velocity for the whole refine, on an audio latent that was also 1.6x too hot for
where the schedule was. The picture came back sharp and the sound came back as
static, on generated and supplied audio alike. The refine now holds the sound
with the same nested denoise mask the face pass and supplied sound already use —
ones for the picture, zeros for the sound — so the model reads the soundtrack
while it redraws the frames and hands it back exactly as the first pass left it.
One-pass renders were never affected, which is why setting the render to a
single pass worked around it.

**The tools dashboard shows what each tool does to a real picture, instead of
grey glyphs.** Every card behind the wordmark wore the same rounded box with a
grey glyph cropped into the corner, so the grid was six shapes distinguished by
their captions — nothing on it invited a press. Each card now opens on a
picture, and what the card does to that picture is what the tool does to a
frame: ControlNet's is cut down the middle against a real depth pass of itself,
upscale's against a low-resolution copy of itself, presets' is dealt out as a
deck. Both seams are dragged rather than animated — they sit wherever the
pointer is.

The two Go-to cards show the piece you are on — the pre-stage still, and the same
still ruled into frames for a shot that has not rendered yet — because that is
what they take you to. The benches carry plates of their own, shipped in
`web/creator/cards/`: one set, one warm key on black, each picture chosen for what
its card does to it — and ControlNet's ships two, the frame and the depth map the
bench itself made of it, rather than a browser filter standing in for one. A piece
with nothing on it yet still falls back to the glyph.

**The `@` menu now opens on what is attached to the card, before the cast.** The
menu led with everybody in the piece, which is an argument about what matters in
a prompt rather than about the moment somebody types `@` — the picture they just
dropped on the card is what they are reaching for, and it was sitting under a
list of names. Order is now attached, cast, cast library, piece references,
input folder.

**Fixed: dragging a bench seam could drag the picture out of the page instead.**
A pointer that presses an `<img>` and moves is a drag of that image as far as
the browser is concerned, so the light box would sometimes lift a ghost of the
frame, hand it to the room's own drop zone — which lit up as though a file were
arriving — and stop following the hand. Three fixes, because it took three:
every picture in a bench is `draggable="false"`, the frame and the locator
refuse `dragstart`, and the drop zone now only wakes for a drag that is actually
carrying files (`dom.dragsFiles`), rather than for every drag that crosses it.
The CSS `-webkit-user-drag` that was supposed to cover this says it to one
engine out of three.

**The wordmark closes a bench as well as opening one.** A tool opened from the
dashboard could only be left by the ✕ at the far end of the bar, while the mark
in the corner — the thing that drops the tools everywhere else in this pack —
sat there as inert text. It is the same button on both benches now: it closes
the room and puts the cards back up, so leaving a tool is the press that entered
it. It is only a button where there is somewhere to go back to; a bench opened
with no dashboard behind it keeps the plain wordmark.

**The "Double-click for fullscreen" tooltip is gone from render previews.**
"Double-click for fullscreen" popped up over every finished still and clip
whenever the pointer rested on them — a hint charged against the one element in
the node body worth looking at. The double-click still opens fullscreen.

**An upscale bench for stills and clips, with two backends: Sharpen (GAN) and
Restore (SeedVR2).** The pack's three ways of enlarging anything were all
attached to a render — the two-pass first stage, a family's own second stage,
the LTX re-detail — and none of them answered *here is a file, make it bigger*.
A second bench does, on the wordmark's dashboard beside the ControlNet one: any
still or clip goes in, and a bigger one lands in `output/continuity/upscaled/`
beside the renders, and the doors the tracing bench offers are here too — a
finished upscale is usually the next shot's reference or the picture the next
still is drawn from, and the trip through the picker to find it was the part
worth saving.

Two backends, and the choice between them is a choice between promises.
**Sharpen** is a GAN through core's `UpscaleModelLoader` and its tiling, so
ESRGAN, DAT, SwinIR and SPAN all load and nothing new is depended on; it
resolves what the pixels already imply and invents nothing. **Restore** is
SeedVR2 through the nodes core ships in `comfy_extras/nodes_seedvr.py` — one
step at cfg 1 over a source latent, so it is a repair rather than a generation:
compression, grain and the softness of a frame that was small to begin with. On
a clip it reads several frames at once, because a restoration done frame by
frame boils. *Bigger by* means what it says on both, whatever factor the model
was trained at — a x4 GAN asked for x2 runs once and comes back down, and
SeedVR2 works at the size the picture is resampled to.

A clip keeps its soundtrack and its timing; the trim bar cuts the span first,
and one press takes just the frame under the playhead. The light box shows a
*tile at output size* rather than the whole frame, wiped against plain
resampling instead of against the source, because a model that beats a picture a
quarter of the size has not shown you anything. The resampled half follows the
dials; the model half is a press — **Try it here**, in the corner of the glass.
Every backend on this bench is weights, so a preview that followed the sliders
put a multi-gigabyte checkpoint load behind a click on a *row*, and reading what
Restore was for started running it. Re-detail stays where it is: it
re-renders rather than resolves, and one verb over two different promises would
be a lie about one of them.

**Both benches share one look: a film-edge rail, operators as rows, and less
shouting about missing models.** Both of them drew a very wide column of four
labelled groups, each under a hairline ruled across the whole width, with the
operators as a wrapping row of pills — and at this pack's larger text scales
that read as a page of documentation with some sliders in it, the ragged pills
carrying "no model" tags that made the operators you *cannot* use the loudest
things in the list. The room is now one stylesheet (`styles/bench.js`) that both
benches wear, and the rail is a strip of film: a line down its edge, a tick at
every stop, the stop's name set small against it. The operators are rows with a
left edge to read down, the missing-model state is a ring rather than a tag,
prose is clamped to two lines and opens on a press, a stepped dial draws the
stops it actually has, and the foot of the rail says which folder the file will
land in. The amber is spent in three places and nowhere else: the tick on the
stop you are on, the seam under your hand, and the button that runs the job.

**Both benches share one backend (`creator/bench.py`), which brings chunked clip
work and a real progress bar.** Reading a frame off whatever was dropped in,
filling a dial from the model folders, clamping what the sliders sent, naming
the file and transcoding a clip frame by frame with its sound and its timestamps
intact — all of it was written for the tracing bench, all of it was general, and
it is `creator/bench.py` now. Nothing about tracing changed; what came with the
move is a progress bar on an untrimmed clip, which the shared transcode now
counts out of the container's own frame count instead of only reporting on a cut
span — and the chunking Restore needs, which is the shared transcode's too:
`work` takes a run of frames rather than one, `chunk` says how many, and
`overlap` says how many the next chunk re-does so the two can be crossfaded on
core's own curve. Chunks sampled independently do not join invisibly, and a step
every few seconds is the artefact somebody notices first.

**Flux 2 Klein is a family: BFL's compact Flux 2 at 4B or 9B, base or 4-step
turbo.** BFL's compact Flux 2 — 4B (Apache 2.0) or 9B (non-commercial), both the
base checkpoint and the 4-step distillation the turbo pill swaps in — joins the
pre-stage's model pill as `flux2klein`. It draws from prose and edits from
pictures natively: references are VAE-encoded and chained onto the conditioning
(`ReferenceLatent`), no adapter LoRA to add, and the first picture is the one
being edited, so the canvas follows it, with *start blank* as the way out — Qwen
Image Edit's arrangement. The graph is the official template's: `Flux2Scheduler`
shapes the schedule from the steps and the canvas (so the family declares no
scheduler control at all) through `SamplerCustomAdvanced`, and the text encoder
is the plain Qwen3 loaded as CLIPLoader type `flux2` — the text-only cut is
correct here, and the vision check knows to let it through. One family covers
both sizes: pick the checkpoint and the Qwen3 encoder that matches it. The `kv`
build is left for later — it wants a `FluxKVCache` graph this family does not
emit yet.

**Fixed: casting somebody into a clip swapped only their face, not the whole
person.** Casting somebody into a clip compiled to the one prompt shape H3 reads
as "keep the person and re-animate them": the newcomer was marked
`attribute_transfer` — whose meaning in the reference guide is that the *target*
subject stays identifiable — and the retention line said their features were
"transferred onto" the outgoing person, whose framing was kept. The model did
what it was told and moved the face. The swap now compiles the way the guide's
own combined-source example is written: the newcomer is `fully_preserved` with
their appearance from the picture and the vacancy named in their definition, and
the clip's own line is where the swap is scoped — `partially_preserved`,
everything and everyone else kept, "while ⟨who⟩ is replaced by ⟨Subject N⟩". A
clip somebody is cast into counts as an edit source even if its chip was never
narrowed to *edit* by hand.

**A Matte tracing on the ControlNet bench masks the swap, so only the named
person is regenerated.** A new *Matte* tracing on the ControlNet bench asks SAM
3 — the same checkpoint the face pass and the picker's click-scissors read — who
goes, in words ("person", or "the man in the red shirt"), and writes them as
white on black, grown past their outline by a dial so the replacement has room
to be a different build. Thrown as a guide on a shot that carries an edit clip,
it runs the Fun ControlNet-Union's other trained mode, video inpainting:
everything outside the white is conditioned to stay the source clip at latent
level rather than asked to in prose, and only the person is regenerated.
Inverted, it is the other job — keep the named subject, replace the world around
them.

**Swap one cast member for another in one gesture, keeping their clips, their
slot and every mention of them.**

Removing a cast member took the clip they stood in with them. That clip is the
shot — attached, trimmed and narrowed to *edit* before anybody was cast into it
— so changing your mind about who is swapped into it deleted the shot along
with the casting decision, and the only way back was to attach and re-cut the
video again. It stays now, with the narrowing it was given. What still leaves
with a departing member is what they were *built out of*: their own pictures,
their voice, the clip they move like.

And there is a way to make the swap in one gesture rather than four. The ⇄ on
an open cast card opens the roster; whoever you pick takes the outgoing
member's place — the clips they stood in, the sentence about what is being
changed in them, and their slot in the cast order, which is also their subject
number. Every sentence in the piece that wrote the old name is rewritten to the
new one, the rewrite included, so nothing has to be edited by hand afterwards.
Swapping one Anna for another takes the name back rather than leaving you with
`@ana_2`.

**The refiner's prompting can be your own `.md` file, and a remote server can be
told to unload the model when it is done (#19).** Two things asked for on
[#19](https://github.com/roadmaus/ComfyUI-Continuity/issues/19) after the remote
backend shipped.

The prompting is yours to write. A `.md` file in the node's `creator/skills/`
folder is offered in the refiner's settings by name, with a switch under it:
*add to the built-in* leaves the node's own instructions, guides, handle checks
and reply format standing and reads your lines after the craft notes, so a
scenario preset can steer a whole-timeline refine without breaking anything;
*replace it* hands your text over as the model's only instruction and keeps the
answer whole, which is exactly how a `.skill` package has always run, one card
at a time. A file can say which it wants in its own frontmatter (`mode:
replace`); a plain paragraph that says nothing is an addition. Skill packages
still default to replacing, and can now be added instead.

And a remote server can be told to let go. "Eject when done" in the server card
asks it to unload the model as soon as the rewrite is in, so the next sampler
pass finds the VRAM free rather than waiting behind an idle LM Studio. It uses
the server's own call for it — LM Studio's `/api/v1/models/unload`, Ollama's
`keep_alive: 0`, and a `ttl` alongside the request for LM Studio builds older
than 0.4 — and a server that can do none of that is left alone rather than
failing the press. Only ever asked of a server on your own machine or LAN: a
hosted API has nothing to evict. The in-process backend never needed the switch
— it has always handed its weights back after every generation.

**The H3 still's length and frame pills are written as cost and time, not as
frames and latent indexes.**

A still on the H3 branch is a video generation with one latent frame decoded,
and both of its pills used to say so out loud: a length list of "39 frames ·
12 latent" and a stepper reading "latent 0". Neither number is a thing anyone
is choosing. Every length yields the same single picture — what a longer one
buys is distribution, not frames — so the list is now a cost ladder, "Draft"
through "≈8.5× draft" to "Trained range", with the frame count as the line
underneath. And the frame index is a time: "first frame" for the causal frame
the decode is exact for, "+0.42 s" for the same shot a moment on. The stepper
no longer offers indexes below zero, and it stays hidden at the cheapest
length, where there are two frames and one of them is right. Saved graphs are
untouched — the stored values and the compiler's negative-from-the-end
indexing are exactly what they were.

**The refiner can run on LM Studio, Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint,
hosted APIs included (#19).**

The refiner's settings grew a "runs on" switch
([#19](https://github.com/roadmaus/ComfyUI-Continuity/issues/19)). "this
ComfyUI" is what it always did: a Qwen3-VL text encoder in-process, loaded and
evicted like any other model. "a server" points it at an OpenAI-compatible
`/v1` instead — LM Studio (`http://localhost:1234/v1`), Ollama
(`http://localhost:11434/v1`), llama.cpp, vLLM, or a hosted API such as
OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic or Gemini via their compatibility endpoints —
with the server's own model list to pick from. Attached references ride along
as images when the model can see; everything else — templates, handle checks,
quoted-span fidelity, the whole rewrite contract — is identical on both
backends.

An API key, where a hosted provider needs one, is handled the way a credential
should be: stored server-side in its own owner-only file, never written to
`localStorage`, never sent back to the browser, never saved into a workflow
`.json`, scrubbed from error messages, refused over plain HTTP to anything but
loopback — and dropped automatically if the server URL changes without a new
key arriving with it, so a repointed URL can never inherit a credential meant
for somewhere else.

**Fixed: a dropped websocket left a finished render ticking forever under a
frozen preview (#24).**

`executed` is broadcast once, to whoever is listening, and is never replayed. So
a websocket that drops mid-render took the end of the render with it: the file
was written and the queue emptied while the node sat on a step preview under a
clock that never stopped, indistinguishable from a hang — and at least one
healthy 179-second render was cancelled by hand because of it
([#24](https://github.com/roadmaus/ComfyUI-Continuity/issues/24)). It does not
take an exotic failure to get there; a reverse proxy with a frame cap, a laptop
that slept, or a tab reopened on a render already running will all do it.

The stage now watches the silence. Half a minute without a step, a frame or a
segment and it starts asking `/history/{prompt_id}` directly — which holds the
same payload the message carried — and a minute of it and the readout says so
rather than ticking a clock under a frozen picture. A reconnected socket asks
immediately. A render that finished unheard lands the way it always did; one
that failed or was cancelled unheard says which, instead of sampling forever.

**Step previews are 640 px by default, with size and quality on their own
settings rails.**

The picture the sampler broadcasts is a full clip, re-encoded and sent on every
step, and it was going out at the override node's own 1024 — several times the
node face it lands in. Past a few megabytes a frame that is not merely wasteful:
a websocket behind a reverse proxy has a frame cap (aiohttp's is 4 MiB, and
nothing raises it by default), and a frame over it does not arrive late, it
drops the socket mid-render. That is what was breaking the connection above.

The default is now 640px, and Settings → General → Step preview carries the size
and the quality on two rails — down for a wire that still cannot carry a long
clip, back up to 1024 for a machine on localhost. Nothing about the render
changes either way: this is the picture you watch while it happens.

**Fixed: right-clicking a step preview offered a dead picture URL, which crashed
ComfyUI Desktop (#30).**

The live preview's `src` is an object URL revoked the moment the next frame
arrives, so every entry in the browser's picture menu — open in a new tab, save
as, copy address — aimed at a URL that had stopped existing by the time it was
used. On ComfyUI Desktop, "open image in new window" crashed the whole app
([#30](https://github.com/roadmaus/ComfyUI-Continuity/issues/30)). The menu is
suppressed on the step frame only; the finished render keeps its own, where the
`src` is a real `/view` URL and "save image as" does what it says.

**Fixed: the refiner invented `@img-1` for a reference clip instead of using its
real handle (#31).**

Every worked example in the built-in prompts is written with `@img-1` and
`@img-2`, and the instruction that asks the model to describe the attached
pictures said only how many there were. So a request whose only reference was a
video — which rides along as one still, giving it a picture but no image handle
— had nothing near the write point saying what to call it, and a 4B model reached
for the handle its example had just used. The invented `@img-1` then ran on
through `subject_definitions` and the shot bodies
([#31](https://github.com/roadmaus/ComfyUI-Continuity/issues/31)).

The handles now ride with the pictures: the `what_i_see` instruction lists them
in attach order and says those are the only ones, the message says which asset
each attached picture is of, and the reference template's example says its own
handles are its own. A `what_i_see` that comes back when nothing was attached is
dropped rather than shown — it was never asked for, and a panel headed "what the
model saw in your images" is a claim about attachments there are none of.

**An H3 still is decoded by the VAE that renders the shot, so it needs no VAE
file of its own.**

The PreStage's H3 branch took one latent frame off a sampled clip and handed it
to the VAE alone. That shape is off the model's grid — H3 packs 17k+5 pixel
frames into 5k+2 latent tokens, so the shortest legal clip is *two* tokens — and
a decoder given one returns tile seams and 16px patch-grid noise rather than a
picture. It was measured at 31.4 mean absolute error tiled and 93.7 untiled,
against 3.92 for a legal decode of the same content
([ComfyUI#15416](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI/issues/15416)). It is why
the branch used to ask for `minimax_h3_t1_image_vae_step1597`: an experimental
decoder retrained on 51k images to make the illegal shape decodable, at the cost
— its own card says so — of soft text, hair and microtexture, and of every video
decode in the same workflow if you left it in the slot.

The slice now hands the VAE the shortest clip the chosen token can live in —
itself, twice — and the still is pixel frame 0 of the five that come back. That
frame is exact for index 0: the VAE is causal, so the first pixel frame is a
function of the first token alone and never sees the copy. Nothing else about
the branch changes, and the file you need is the video VAE already in the slot.
If you fetched the image VAE for this, you can stop pointing at it.

**Qwen Image Edit joins the pre-stage as a fifth family, and it is the one that
edits a picture you already have.**

The pre-stage could draw a picture from a sentence, twice over — Krea 2 and
Ideogram 4.0 — and it could not do the thing this pack is named after: take the
frame you already have and change one thing about it. Qwen Image Edit is a fifth
family and does exactly that. Attach the last frame of shot 1, write "the coat
is red now", and what comes back is the same person in the same room, on the
same canvas, ready to be shot 9's start frame.

It reads up to three pictures on the base weights — no adapter first, which is
the difference from Krea 2's reference path — and the first of them is not a
reference at all. It is the picture being changed, so it sets the canvas and the
render starts from it rather than from noise; the chip says `editing` where the
others say `style`, and the aspect pill reads "from image" without an init image
being attached. Cite the other two from the prompt as `@handle` the way you
always have; they arrive as `Picture 2` and `Picture 3`, the labels the encoder
itself writes.

Everything it emits is core's — the Qwen encoder Krea 2 already borrows, pointed
at the weights it was built for. Three files: the 2511 or 2509 checkpoint, the
Qwen2.5-VL 7B encoder, and the Qwen image VAE Krea 2 already loads. The turbo
pill is a Lightning LoRA and only a LoRA, since there is no distilled checkpoint
to swap to. The schedule shift core does not detect for these weights is put
back, and the unconditional branch is a second pass of the edit encoder over the
same pictures rather than a zeroed copy of the first — a zeroed copy keeps the
reference latents but hands the model a text stream of zeros in place of the
encoder's reading of the pictures, which is not the unconditional this edit
post-training was fitted against. At cfg 1 it *is* the zeroed copy, because a distilled run never
evaluates a negative and a 7B encoder pass for a tensor nothing reads is most of
a four-step render.

Switching the model pill now writes the arriving family's own sampler row rather
than Krea 2's for everyone.

**References are now refused with a reason when they would be silently ignored —
wrong LoRA, wrong edition, text-only encoder, mismatched aspect.**

Every way a reference image can be attached and then not read has been made a
refusal rather than a worse picture.

Krea 2 asked only that the LoRA stack was not empty. It asks now *which* entry
reads the references, on a pill beside the layout pill, because a stack holding
a style LoRA and nothing that reads pictures passed the old check and rendered
as though no reference had been attached at all. A reference render on Krea 2's
RAW row also builds its unconditional the way Qwen Image Edit's does — the same
pictures with nothing asked of them — instead of a zeroed copy, which is the row
these adapters were trained against. And Turbo now refuses a removal: distilled
at cfg 1 there is no guidance to push against the reference, so it re-draws the
subject it was asked to delete. Take the switch off and let RAW do it.

Qwen Image Edit has an edition pill. The encoder has three image slots on every
edition, but the first Qwen-Image-Edit weights were post-trained on one picture
— and nothing in the checkpoint says which release it is, so the filename is
guessed from and the pill is where you correct it. A picture past what the
edition reads is drawn struck through rather than silently dropped, and the
compile refuses it by name.

The text encoder is checked for its vision tower before a render with pictures
in it starts. Both VL encoders ship in a text-only cut that loads without
complaint, tokenizes the sentence without complaint, and then has nothing to
encode the references with — a render that ignored every picture it was given
and looked like a prompting problem. Safetensors and GGUF alike, read from the
header rather than by loading anything, and a file that cannot be read is not
held against you.

Krea 2 also warns when a reference's shape does not match the canvas: those
adapters were trained on pairs whose aspects agreed, and what they preserve
falls off when they do not.

**Attached pictures are labelled for what the family reads them as, and the
first one can be cited rather than edited.**

On Qwen Image Edit the second and third chips said `style`, which names the one
property those weights do not read an attached picture for — an edit model is
being told what is *in* the picture. They say `Picture 2` and `Picture 3` now,
which is both what the encoder writes in front of them and what the prompt cites
them by; `style reference` stays on Krea 2, where an attached image really does
contribute its look. The prompt placeholder, the window subtitle and the refusal
messages follow the same split.

And `editing` on the first chip is a button. These are Qwen-Image weights
post-trained rather than replaced, so "here are three pictures, now draw a
fourth" is a render they can do — and promoting the first picture to the thing
being edited was quietly taking it away, because attaching a picture was what
turned the render into an edit of it. Click the word and the render draws onto
an empty canvas at the aspect pill's shape, with every picture merely cited. An
init image still overrides both, since it is the only way to ask for a partial
denoise.

**Qwen Image Edit's built-in ControlNet works: a guide goes to a picture slot
instead of the init image.**

2509 and 2511 have ControlNet post-trained into the weights: a depth pass, an
edge map or a pose skeleton arriving in an ordinary image slot is followed, with
nothing to load and no strength to set. Core's own blueprints for both editions
are three plain image inputs and no control input, which is why there was
nothing to wire — and why the bug was invisible. Every guide the tracing bench
made went to the **init image**, and an edge map in the init slot is a picture
being restyled at denoise 0.65: what came back was a tidied edge map.

A guide sent to a pre-stage on those editions is now a picture, chipped `guide`,
with the canvas taking its shape. On Krea 2, Ideogram and the first Qwen edition
it is still the init image, because that is the only slot those weights have
that means "start from this arrangement" — and a guide handed to the first Qwen
edition is refused outright rather than quietly edited. A tracing outside the
three the weights were trained on (`lines`, `blocks`, a raw frame) is flagged on
the chip: it will be read as a picture of a drawing, not as something to aim at.

**Sending a picture to the pre-stage now opens the pre-stage.**

A picture handed over used to land in a blob nobody was looking at, and the
press that sends it is followed every time by writing the instruction that goes
with it. `↻ edit` and the bench's *Send to pre-stage* now put the pre-stage in
front: the step, inside the fullscreen shell, and the window on the canvas. The
bench closes behind the send, since the guide exists to be written a prompt
around.

**`↻ edit` puts a finished still back into the pre-stage as the next render's
subject.**

Three chips on a result send it *on* — to the shot, as a start frame, an end
frame or a reference. There is a fourth now and it is the loop: `↻ edit` puts
the render you are looking at back into the pre-stage as the next one's subject.
You edited a picture, the edit is right about one thing and wrong about another,
and what you want to change now is the thing on screen. The way round used to be
the picker, four presses away, hunting for your own output among everything else
in the folder.

Where it lands is the arch's own answer to "the picture this render is about":
the first picture slot on a family that edits — replaced, keeping its handle, so
a prompt citing `@ref-1` is still citing what is in front of it — the init image
on one that draws, the request's start frame on the H3 branch. It draws whether
or not the node has a shot attached, which is the one chip here that never
needed one.

While wiring it: the ControlNet bench's **Send to pre-stage** button has never
appeared. It looks for `takeGuide` on the node's body and the method was one
class further in, so the target was silently dropped every time. It is on the
body now.

**A Contact sheet tool: lay a clip out as nine frames in one picture, edit it,
and cut the frames back out.**

The observation Qwen-Video-Edit is built on is that an image editor will edit a
*contact sheet* of frames as though it were one picture, and hold the subject
across the tiles — and the half of that which needs no training, no projections
and no second VAE is a grid, an edit, and a pair of scissors. So the pre-stage's
rail has a **Contact sheet** tool: hand it a clip and it lays nine frames out as
one gutterless picture, hand it a sheet and it cuts the frames back out into the
input folder in order. In between is an ordinary Qwen Image Edit render with the
sheet as the picture being changed.

Gutterless on purpose: a seam is one more thing for the model to reproduce, and
a bare grid makes the cut on the way out the same arithmetic as the lay on the
way in — which matters, because the edited sheet comes back on a /16 canvas that
need not divide by three. There is no server half; a browser already decodes
video and already draws to a canvas, and every frame this touches was on its way
to the input folder anyway.

**The LoRA grid groups a model's versions onto one card, with a pill for each
version.**

A LoRA you have retrained four times was four cards: four near-identical
thumbnails under four identical titles, with nothing on any of them saying that
the other three existed. Its files are one card now, and the version is a row of
pills wearing only the part of the filename its siblings do not share — `v1`
against `v2` against `v2_lite`, which is the part you are actually choosing
between. Civitai's model id groups them wherever a sidecar carries one; a folder
of hand-trained files falls back to the filename, taking off the version tails
people write there anyway, and stays inside one folder while it does it, because
two people's `style_v1` are two different LoRAs.

Two things it deliberately does not group. Wan's split LoRAs publish a high-noise
file and a low-noise one under one model id, and those go in a stack *together* —
a card offering a choice between them would hide half of what you need — so a
name saying which half it is keeps its own card, and so does a t2v beside its
i2v.

Clicking a pill while one of that model's versions is in the stack is a swap in
place: same slot, same weight, same checkpoint, different file. The trigger words
come from the file now loaded, because a retrain renames them. The pin beside the
pills keeps one version as the one that model opens on, which is a fact about
your collection rather than about this piece, so it outlives the window. The
detail sheet grew the same choice as an **On this disk** list you can land on —
the sheet redraws around whichever version you pick, so the showcase and the
recipe are what you compare rather than two filenames — with the sidecar's full
published list below it.

**The LoRA weight slider's range follows the file — ±2 up to ±25, so slider
LoRAs are reachable.** Slider LoRAs are trained as a signed axis and are meant
to be driven to ±10 and past it; the track ran -1 to 2, so half of what those
files can do was unreachable and the other half was four pixels of travel. The
row carries the span as a control — ±2, ±5, ±10, ±25, each one about eighty
notches wide, so the drag feels the same at every scale — and it is picked for
you: a file whose own name says slider opens at ±10, one your last setup left at
6.5 opens wide enough to show 6.5, everything else opens at ±2, where an
ordinary LoRA's whole useful range finally gets the full track. The weight
beside it is typed rather than read, which is the one control that reaches any
value at all; typing past the track widens the span instead of clipping what you
asked for.

**A ControlNet bench: footage in, a guide out — Edges, Lines, Blocks, Luma,
Blur, Depth, Pose or As shot.**

The bench is a room of its own, reached from the dashboard the wordmark opens.
Footage goes in — dropped on it, or picked out of the input folder — and a guide
comes out: **Edges** (Canny), **Lines** (a difference-of-Gaussians drawing),
**Blocks**, **Luma** and **Blur**, plus **As shot** for a clip that needs only
cutting or its soundtrack stripped.

**Depth and Pose tracings, through the Depth Anything 3 and SDPose nodes ComfyUI
already ships.** and **Pose** are there too, and they are model work rather than
arithmetic: Depth Anything 3 and SDPose, both of which ComfyUI already ships in
`comfy_extras`. The bench loads what core loads and draws the skeleton with
core's own `KeypointDraw`, which is where the DWPose colour tables the pose
ControlNets were trained on actually live — a skeleton in a palette of its own
is one a ControlNet reads as a different pose. Neither downloads anything: the
file is picked on the same weights pill the pre-stage and the shot wear — same
popover, same chooser — and a tracing whose files are missing says which files
and which folder rather than going quiet. The bench has no piece to save a pick
into, so the pick is remembered per machine in the user settings beside
`weights`: which file on this disk is the depth model is a fact about the disk,
and being asked again every time the bench opens is being asked forever. Depth
measures its near and far once and holds them for the rest of the cut, because
normalising each frame against its own extremes is the usual reason a
depth-guided render flickers.

Nothing about the other five queues. Those tracings are arithmetic over pixels,
written against numpy and `scipy.ndimage` so the pack still declares no
dependencies of its own, and the server answers a single preview frame fast
enough that the picture redraws while a threshold is under the pointer — and
fast enough that a running clip is traced *as it plays*, one request in the air
at a time, so the two halves of the wipe stay the same moment. A guide already
written plays there instead, held against the footage frame for frame, and comes
off the glass the moment a dial moves it out of date. The two pictures share one
rectangle with a draggable seam rather than sitting side by side, because the
question being asked is whether the tracing follows the frame it came from, and
that is invisible until they are on top of each other.

A video source can be cut before it is traced, and its sound kept or stripped.
The cut is the reference trim editor's own bar — `trim.js` grew a `mountTrim`
that puts it inline instead of in a modal — so the handles, the rigid-window
drag, the arrow keys, the looping transport and the waveform behind them are the
same code the picker has always opened, and the playhead you scrub is what the
light box is showing. On the way out the cut keeps the source's own timestamps
rather than counting frames out at the container's average rate: every phone clip
is variable-rate, and counting made a two-second cut into a three-second file
that played slow.

What comes out is a file in `input/continuity/control/`. **Send to pre-stage**
makes it the still's init image; **Send to the shot** attaches it as a reference.
Neither is required, and neither is wiring the bench owns — the file is in the
picker either way.

The dashboard also grows a **Go to** group above the tools: Pre-stage and Shot,
each one press to that half of the piece alone in the middle of the screen.
Pressing Pre-stage when the piece has none spawns it on the way. It was three
presses in two places before — the view switch in the bar, then the step switch
on the card, which is not even drawn until the view is simple.

**Fixed: four sampling settings in the pre-stage did not match what Krea 2's and
Ideogram's authors specified.** Four things were wrong in the pre-stage, and
each of them was quiet — nothing errored, the pictures were just worse than the
weights can do.

*Ideogram's low-guidance polish tail.* Every official preset ends on a fixed
number of steps at guidance 3 instead of 7 — three of Quality's 48, two of
Default's 20, one of Turbo's 12 — and this pack asked for it as a flat 30% of
the trajectory, which is the approximation the shipped ComfyUI template makes.
On a 1K canvas that gave Quality *seven* polish steps instead of three; on a 2K
canvas it gave Turbo none at all, because Ideogram's schedule carries a
resolution term and the boundary moves with it. The tail is now resolved against
the sigmas the render will really run, so "the last three steps" is three steps
at any preset and any canvas.

*Krea 2 RAW's timestep shift.* Krea derives RAW's shift from the canvas — the
`--y1 0.5 / --y2 1.15` ramp in its own inference code — and pins it only for
Turbo, which was distilled against a constant. ComfyUI detects one architecture
for both files and so gives both of them Turbo's pin, which left RAW sampling a
1K canvas on a schedule meant for a 2K distilled render. RAW gets its ramp back
on every render; Turbo keeps the pin, and emits no shift node at all because the
pin is what the checkpoint already detected.

*Style references need an adapter, and now say so.* Krea 2's base weights read
no reference at all: core hands the DiT no default reference method because it
never learned one. Every way of reading a reference on this model is a LoRA —
`krea2_style_reference` for style, an ai-toolkit edit LoRA for edits — and
attaching images without one was conditioning that never reached the sampler.
That is refused now rather than rendered, and because the published adapters
disagree about how reference tokens are laid into the sequence (pinned at
timestep zero, or indexed like any other frame) the layout is a pill on the
references row rather than a constant.

*Turbo is a LoRA too.* Krea ships its distillation twice — as its own checkpoint
and as an SVD extraction of the same weight difference — and the pill now offers
both: the LoRA route keeps RAW resident across a flick of the switch and lets a
content LoRA ride along. Ideogram, which ships no distilled checkpoint at all,
gets the pill for the first time: a distillation LoRA over the ordinary
checkpoint takes it to a handful of steps at cfg 1, where the unconditional
checkpoint is no longer loaded and the polish tail has no guidance left to drop.
The switch is per architecture, so flipping the model pill no longer carries one
family's file onto the other; blobs written before the split are read as Krea
2's, which is the only side that had one.

**A pre-stage render previews beside the node instead of being painted onto
it.** The two image architectures — Krea 2 and Ideogram 4.0 — sampled behind
ComfyUI's own previewer, whose frames the frontend paints onto the canvas node
itself: under the stage card that should be showing them, and invisible in the
fullscreen editor. They now carry the same KJNodes preview override the video
render and the H3 still already did, which broadcasts the frames the stage reads
and suppresses core's overlay. As everywhere else it is optional: without the
pack installed nothing is emitted and the render is identical.

**Fixed: the strip's reel went blank after turning the card.** In the fullscreen
editor's simple view, switching between Pre-stage and Shot left every block on
the timeline reel unlabelled — no shot number, no length — until the node was
resized. The reel decides what it can print by measuring how wide its blocks
came out, and it was asking for the *painted* width: the card is rotated on its
vertical axis while it turns, so a measurement taken during the turn found every
block a few pixels wide and stripped the labels off all of them. A turn changes
nothing the reel's resize observer reports, so nothing ever asked again. It
measures the laid-out width now, which is the question it meant to ask.

**The wordmark in the fullscreen editor opens a dashboard of tools.** In the
fullscreen editor, pressing **Continuity** in the title bar turns the room over
to the dashboard: the editor's tools, as cards, over the whole width under the
title bar. One card today — the preset library, the same one the rail's Presets
button opens — beside a marked-out place for the tools still to come, which is
where they will appear. Pressing the mark again, pressing Escape, or opening a
card puts the piece back exactly as you left it. No keystroke is claimed for it:
every pack on the canvas wants ⌘K, so the dashboard is the mark's alone. Nothing
else about the window changes, and no new chrome stands open while you work.

**The pack is renamed Continuity, with a new repo and Comfy Registry entry.**
"MiniMax Creator" named the only thing it could render when it was written; it
now renders on four families — MiniMax H3, LTX 2.5, Krea 2 and Ideogram 4.0 —
and a fifth is a directory with a declaration in it. Continuity is the script
supervisor's job: the same person, the same prop and the same light in shot 1
and in shot 9, which is the cast, the piece references and the seams, and the
one thing that stays true whichever family renders the frames.

**The rename moves nothing you have made: saved workflows, presets and settings
are all carried over.** Saved workflows load untouched — the node class ids
never changed, only what they are called on the canvas — and your presets,
picker favourites, LoRA memory, refiner settings and machine settings are all
read under their old names on the first open and written back under the new one.
An install that had typed its own output folder keeps writing there; only the
untouched default moves from `output/minimax/` to `output/continuity/`. The one
casualty is the fullscreen setting and any custom keybinding for it, which go
back to their defaults; Ctrl+Shift+M is unchanged. `docs/RENAME.md` is the whole
manifest, including what is frozen forever and why.

The pack also has a new home — `github.com/roadmaus/ComfyUI-Continuity` — and a
new Comfy Registry entry, `continuity`. An existing clone keeps pulling through
GitHub's redirect.

**Each family files its renders and stills under its own name, with a folder
setting per family.** A piece shot on LTX 2.5 was written to
`output/minimax/renders/H3_00021_.mp4` — the wrong shelf and another
architecture's name on the file — because where a render landed was one constant
for the whole pack, decided when H3 was the only thing in it. It is decided by
whatever rendered it now: renders go to `continuity/renders/<family>/`, stills
to `continuity/stills/<family>/`, and a piece shot a pass at a time keeps its
takes in that family's own `takes/` folder.

Settings → Folders has a row per family to match, so a family can be sent
anywhere without moving the others. A machine that had typed its own folder
keeps it: the old single setting is read as an answer for every family of its
kind, which is what it was, and only the untouched default gives way to the new
layout.

**The first card of a piece can be locked, because the render itself is now
reported as its take.** A render of one generation used to be told there was
nothing to keep — its take *was* the render, so writing the same frames out a
second time would have been one file to keep and one to delete. True about the
file and wrong about the card: a piece shot a pass at a time starts as one card
generated whole, and that card came back with no take on it, so locking it left
nothing to play and the only way to add a second shot was to shoot the first one
again. The save node now reports the render itself as that card's take. Nothing
extra is written and nothing on disk moves.

**The turbo LoRA shows as the switch's own entry on the strip's rail instead of
a long filename.** Thrown on, it is an ordinary entry in the piece's stack —
which is the point, and it stays one — but the piece rail drew it like a file
you had picked, forty characters of `..._turbo_v4_step600_ema_pruned` beside the
pill that had just dropped the filename for exactly that reason. It wears the
switch's bolt and the word "turbo" now, with the file in the tooltip. The shot
face never showed it: its rail is the segment's stack, and turbo's LoRA belongs
to the piece.

**The LoRA manager remembers a file's strength and trigger words across
pieces.** A strength you arrived at by trying it, and the two words out of a
sidecar's nine that actually did anything, used to live on the entry in
creator_data — which is to say they lived until the ✕, and the next piece
started again from the file's own guess. They are kept per file now, and adding
a LoRA anywhere picks up where you left it. A card whose settings came from you
rather than from its sidecar says so, and a file nobody has used yet still
starts from whatever its sidecar recorded.

Trigger words are kept the same way, including the ones that are switched off.
A word you type is part of that LoRA's vocabulary from then on: switch it off and
the chip stays, so turning it back on is a click rather than retyping it. The ✕
on a chip of your own is what forgets one for good.

**Opening the LoRA manager from a chip lands on that LoRA's card.** It lands on
the card, in whatever folder the file is in, and marks it for a moment. Before
this the window opened on the folder you happened to be in last, scrolled to the
top, with no hint of which of several hundred cards you had just clicked.

**Star a LoRA, and save whole stacks as presets.** The scope picker now offers
two shelves above the folder list — Favorites and Recently used — and the
shelves are read by name rather than by walking a folder, so a starred file
stays reachable even in a folder past the listing cap. A file that has been
renamed or deleted since you starred it is named as missing rather than quietly
dropped.

A stack you have built is kept under the manager's own Stacks tab, as a preset
holding nothing but its LoRAs: it is the same body the preset library writes, so
it lists, exports and cross-applies there like anything else you have kept. Apply
one over the current stack with Replace, or merge it into what is already on the
node with Add.

**LTX 2.5 reads references, through Lightricks' own Ingredients reference
sheet.** The second video family used to refuse every attachment, because a
citation reached its text encoder as a bare `<Picture 1>` with no picture behind
it. It has a reference grammar now, and it is Lightricks' own: pick up to nine
stills and the picker lays them out as an Ingredients reference sheet — panels
on a black background — which the render hands to the transformer as a guide
through the `Ingredients` IC-LoRA, with the caption written in two parts,
`Reference sheet: …` then `Generated video: …`.

The whole of the reference system is the one you already had. The same chips,
the same handles, the same cast, the same pool, the same refiner panel. What
changes is the words: a reference is `panel 1` of the sheet rather than
`<Picture 1>` of a presentation, and a start frame is `the first frame` rather
than an ordinal, because Gemma reads captions and an ordinal there is a token
sequence standing where a noun phrase belongs. H3 is untouched — same ordinals,
same Context-IR, byte-identical graphs.

Videos and sounds are still turned away on this family, and the refusal says why
rather than counting to nothing: a clip has no panel to be. Lay it on the
piece's sound lane, or put the piece on H3, which reads both. The rail offers
the tools the family can actually use, so an LTX piece draws "Add image" alone.

Pick the Ingredients IC-LoRA under the weights control. Every canvas axis has to
divide by the adapter's own downscale factor times 32; a canvas that does not is
refused before anything loads, naming the pill to move.

**The reference sheet is built while you pick, in an editor that shows what the
model will be handed.** On LTX 2.5 the image selection *is* the sheet — that is
the family's grammar, one composite per shot — so pressing Add opens the sheet
editor: the composite exactly as the model will be handed it, on the black field
the adapter was trained against, with the panels in a strip below. Drag a panel
to rearrange (the numbering is the citation — `panel 3` in the caption is cell 3
of the grid), press the scissors to cut one out of its background or keep it
whole, take one off with the ✕, and confirm. A card on this family carries one
image reference and the render loads that file; a request carrying loose seconds
is refused rather than composed behind your back.

On H3 nothing is welded together for you: multi-select attaches separate
references, as it always did, and each is encoded on its own. The new Connect
button in the picker's foot is how a sheet happens there — select two or more
pictures, press it, and the same editor lays them out on mid grey. The result
attaches as ONE reference, storyboard-style, costing one of H3's slots however
many panels are on it, and rides alongside the loose references. The paired
pictures stay connected: reopen the picker and they come back selected and
numbered, ready to be edited, extended, or dismantled, while you keep adding
other references around them.

The scissors are core's BiRefNet matte — no prompt, no box, no click. A
reference image is a photograph, and a photograph is mostly not the thing it is
a reference *of*: cite somebody's portrait for their face and the model is also
handed the room they stood in. Panels start cut on LTX 2.5, where they are
ingredients rather than photographs, and whole on H3, where every piece ever
saved was rendered against whole pictures.

What lands on the card is one reference: the sheet, as a real file in the input
folder, with the pictures it was laid out from listed on its card. Those keep
their handles, so `@img-2` still means the second panel and the cast still
claims it — `panel 2` in an LTX caption, `panel 2 of <Picture 1>` in H3's. Open
the sheet's name to change what a panel reads as, or Edit sheet… to build it
again — also offered on a plain picture, which is a sheet of one nobody has
added to yet, and where the scissors on a lone H3 reference live.

Pick a background-removal model under weights; it is loaded the first time you
press the scissors and held for the session. Nothing about a cutout or a layout
happens at render time any more — the graph loads no matte and composes no
sheet, and a selection you have built before comes back without a second pass.

**The sheet editor composites in the browser, so nothing is written to disk
until you accept.** The editor used to show a server-built composite and rebuild
it — as a real file in `input/_plates/` — on every click, so an afternoon of
picking left the folder full of discarded previews and the All shelf full of
half-made sheets. Both halves are gone. The preview is composited in the
browser, from per-panel cutouts the server serves straight out of memory, and
the composite is written exactly once: when Accept (or Add, for a Connect group)
commits it. Cancel leaves no file anywhere, `_plates/` no longer appears on the
All shelf (its own shelf still holds it), and Organize grew a Mark all button —
which is also how the sheets an earlier version littered are cleared in one
press.

The stage is the shot's own canvas, and the panels on it are where they will
actually sit. Drag one to place it, take its corner to resize it, reorder the
citations in the strip below; Auto-arrange puts everything back on the grid.
The arrangement is part of the sheet's identity — the same panels laid out
differently are a different file — and part of its caption: an unarranged
`panel 3` is still described by its grid cell, a dragged one by where it
landed, against thirds of the canvas, so "panel 1 is the person top right"
stays a sentence the model can check against the picture in front of it.

**Click the subject and SAM 3 cuts exactly that panel out, instead of BiRefNet
lifting everything salient.** BiRefNet's matte is salient-object — hand it a
picture of two people and it lifts both. The editor now has "Click to choose the
subject": click the thing you mean and the panel's matte comes from SAM 3's
point path instead, shift-click marks what to leave out, every click is a dot
you can press to take back, and the mask is feathered a couple of pixels so a
hard edge does not read as a sticker. Clicks are part of the sheet's name too,
and they ride with the panel, so reopening the editor starts from them. Pick a
SAM 3 checkpoint under weights — on H3 it is the same file the face pass already
uses; without one the scissors still work whole-subject, and the first click
tells you what is missing.

**The refiner writes the prompt the piece's own family was trained on, not
always H3's.** The Refine button was written when H3 was the only family, and it
stayed H3's after there were two: whatever the piece's model pill said, the
route compiled the request as H3, derived an H3 mode name for it, and rewrote
the prose into Context-IR — section headers, `[Shot 2]` markers, cut timestamps
and `<Picture 1>` ordinals. On LTX 2.5 every one of those is a token sequence
Lightricks trained the weights never to see, sitting exactly where a description
belongs, so refining a piece on that family made its prompt worse rather than
better.

The refiner has come apart into the half that is the harness and the half that
is a statement about a checkpoint. The harness — `@handle` storage, the citation
and quoted-span checks, the ChatML turns, the reply budget, the grounding pass
over attached pictures — is shared and unchanged. Each family now brings its own
templates, mode names, reply contract and glossary, and the button follows the
piece's model pill the moment it moves.

LTX 2.5's is written from Lightricks' own prompting guide: one flowing
present-tense paragraph with no headers, labels or markers of any kind; the shot
established before the scene and the scene before the people; emotion as a
physical cue; camera movement said relative to the subject and resolved after
the move; dialogue in quotation marks in the sentence that speaks it; sound as
heard events. A cut is prose here — "A hard cut transitions to…", the framing
re-established after it, the sound said to continue or drop — so this family is
never asked for cut times, and a lone card that wants several shots writes them
into its one description.

The template pill offers each family's own list, and a pin is kept per family: a
`REF2VA` pinned on an H3 piece no longer rides along into an LTX request as a
name its refiner has never heard of. An existing pin is kept for the family it
was made against.

**Clear now empties the sound lane, and every block carries a ✕ to remove it by
hand.** A laid track is the piece's own sound — the shots under it are generated
against it — so a Clear that left it behind handed the next scene the last one's
soundtrack, and did it silently: nothing on the emptied piece said where that
music was coming from. It also meant a piece with only a lane on it read as
nothing to clear. The files themselves are untouched; what goes is where they
were laid, which is writing like the rest of it.

Taking one off was a keystroke — Delete on a focused block — and a keystroke
nobody has been told about is not a control. Every block now carries a ✕ in its
bottom-right corner, drawn at rest and faint like the trim grips beside it, for
the same reason those are: a handle you only meet once you are on top of it says
it too late.

**Fixed: a card opened from the strip drew the default family's controls instead
of the piece's.** The segment editor was built without being told which piece it
belonged to, so it fell back to the card itself — and a card carries no family.
Every family-derived control in that window was therefore drawn as the default
family: no auto-duration switch on a piece whose weights have a duration head,
H3's mode names over an LTX card, a weights pill for routes LTX does not have,
and attach tools for references the compiler would refuse at queue time. The
strip underneath had all of it right, which is how the same segment came to read
`FL2V` on the card and `FL2VA` in the window over it.

**On a family that reads no attached references, the attach tools are hidden
rather than greyed out.** A disabled button says "this is a thing you could do
here"; on LTX 2.5 it is not one, and no amount of waiting will make it one — the
refusal is about what the model reads. The piece's reference shelf goes with
them, and stays only where files are already on it, so a piece carried over from
H3 can still be emptied. Greying is kept for the case it was meant for: a full
card on a family that does take them.

**Fixed: a shot citing a reference was told to open on the character sheet.**
Since the compiler started asking a family how to read a request, the prompt was
composed as though nothing had been cited — so a reference generation was
written in a keyframe mode and picked up the guide's base-mode alignment line,
"at 0.00 seconds `<Picture 1>` is fully referenced". On that road `<Picture 1>`
is the first *reference*, not a frame the shot opens on: the seam is never
presented to the text encoder there, and an attached start frame is presented
after the references and already named, at the ordinal it really took, by the
line under it. So the prompt told the model to open the shot on the character
sheet.

It bit hardest in a timeline, where the transformer was simultaneously handed
the previous shot's own last frames as pinned guides: the picture the text asked
for and the picture the guides asked for were different, and whatever came out
of that argument was decoded, inherited by the next seam, and argued over again.
A cast-driven chain drifted further from itself with every card.

**The LTX 2.5 sampler row is five pills at rest instead of thirteen, written in
words rather than node names.** Settings → Nodes → Advanced controls never
reached this row: the flag was read past the point where a declared family peels
off to its own renderer, so "Standard" and "Everything" drew the same thing. It
is read per control now, off an `advanced` key each family sets in its own
manifest — so which controls are the last few percent is that family's statement
rather than a list in the frontend. The rule the H3 row already lived by holds:
a control you have set keeps its pill whatever the setting says, because in
force means visible.

Separately, and worth more: on the trained curve the row was drawing five pills
the render does not read, one of them lit. `requires` grew a value form, so
`steps`, the noise curve and the stop-early pair appear only on the `custom`
recipe that builds a schedule out of them. A control that is not read is not a
setting in force, it is a leftover, and the one pill that looked switched on was
the one that could not be doing anything.

The names go with it. `video cfg` and `audio cfg` are **prompt strength** and
**sound strength**; `max shift`/`base shift` are one pill reading **noise curve
0.95 to 2.05**; `stretch sigmas` and `terminal` are **stop early at 0.10**;
`schedule: distilled` is **recipe built-in**. Combos say what they are a choice
about instead of showing a bare value — `sampler res_multistep`, not
`res_multistep` alone. A guidance slider sitting on the value at which it does
nothing reads **detail guidance off** rather than `detail guidance 0.0`, the way
every switch on the row already read. And the `FL2V` badge says **start → end**;
Lightricks' codename moves to the tooltip, since with one transformer there is
no checkpoint for it to be naming. Every technical term stays in the help text,
where somebody searching for it will find it. Nothing on the wire changed: the
options a family stores and sends are the options, renamed only for the pill.

The face pass pill no longer appears on a family that declares no such pass —
it is H3's crop-and-repair loop, and on LTX 2.5 it was a switch for something
that could never run. A piece that somehow carries one switched on keeps the
pill, so it can be switched off.

**LTX 2.5 samples on the fixed sigma curve its checkpoint was distilled against,
with a recipe control to pick between that and the old one.** The family was
building its schedule with `LTXVScheduler` and pairing it with the
`ModelSamplingLTXV` patch — the recipe LTX 2.3 shipped, and the wrong one here.
A step-distilled transformer is not merely a model that takes fewer steps: the
distillation is done against one trajectory, and 2.5's is a constant Lightricks
ships rather than a curve anybody computes. Both of their own 2.5 workflows and
ComfyUI's own template feed nine fixed sigmas through `ManualSigmas` and emit
neither of those two nodes. What this pack was computing instead descended
evenly and then jumped 0.572 straight to 0.1, skipping the stretch below 0.42
where the picture's detail resolves; the trained curve spends four of its eight
steps almost in place at the top and does the whole denoise in four large drops.
The second stage was wrong the same way, and is now the tail Lightricks ships
for it — three steps from 0.85, where the upscaled latent re-enters the
trajectory the first stage left. The sampler default moves to `euler_ancestral`
with them, which is what both stages of both official graphs select: the noise
an ancestral step adds back is part of what eight steps were distilled with.

Which of the two curves a piece is on is a new **recipe** control at the head of
the LTX sampler row, because it is genuinely a choice — the `dev` transformer in
the same slot *is* sampled the old way, at ~20 steps and cfg 3/7, and picking
`custom` brings `LTXVScheduler`, the shift pair and the model patch back along
with the pills that describe them. On the trained curve none of those are read,
and neither is the resolution popover's refine denoise, there being no fraction
to take of a schedule whose every value the distillation fixed. Nothing about H3
moved — its goldens are byte-identical.

**A still handed to LTX 2.5 is compressed and conditioned at 0.7, the way the
official graphs do it.** Every official image-to-video graph for this model
resizes the frame to a 1536 px longest edge and runs it through `LTXVPreprocess`
on the way to the guide, and conditions it at 0.7 rather than pinning it at 1.0.
This pack was passing the image through clean and pinned. The compression is the
load-bearing half: it is what makes a still look like the guide frames the model
was trained to continue from, every one of which came out of a compressed clip,
and a clean one is off-distribution in a way that shows up as an opening second
that sits still and a pass that drifts soft behind it. Seams are untouched at
full strength — the frames a continuing shot inherits are the pass in front's
own, already at this canvas and already out of this VAE, and putting encode
artefacts into them would be inventing damage rather than matching training.

**The editor's take shelf reads newest-first and plays a take over the picture
at full size.** The shelf under the fullscreen editor grew left to right, so the
render you had just made was at the far end of a row that only ever got longer —
the one take anybody reaches for was the one that kept moving away. It reads
outward from the plate now: leftmost is what was on the picture a moment ago,
and the further right you look the older it gets. Each thumbnail also carried a
transport of its own, which is eight scrub bars over eight pictures too small to
scrub; the whole cell is the press instead, and pressing it puts that render on
the plate at full size. Nothing is still until it is pointed at, and then it
plays — along a shelf of takes of the same shot, with the same truncated
filename, motion is what tells one from another.

The take is shown in a layer *over* the plate rather than written into it, which
is why this works in the middle of a render: the sampler goes on sampling
underneath at full speed, and when it lands it lands on the picture you will
come back to instead of over the thing you were looking at. The way back is the
room around the picture, the same thumbnail again, the chip in the corner, or
Escape — which now dismisses the take before it closes the editor. The take
travels between its cell and the plate rather than cross-fading, so which one is
up is said by the movement instead of by a label; a system set to reduced motion
gets the fade.

**Fixed: a render whose audio did not land on an AAC frame boundary failed to
write.** AAC's frame is a fixed 1024 samples and libavcodec refuses any other
length anywhere but the end of the stream — as a bare `avcodec_send_frame()
returned 22`, four frames deep in PyAV, naming nothing. Every part's sound is
cut to the length of its own picture, so landing on a boundary was the
exception: a 6 s shot at 24 fps is 288000 samples, which is 281 frames and a
remainder of 256. Nothing was wrong with the audio and nothing was wrong with
the family — some PyAV builds absorb the short frame and some return the error,
which is why this survived every render made on a box whose PyAV does. The
samples a part ends on are carried into the next part's first frame now, and the
last of them go out with the flush, where a short frame is the one thing that is
allowed.

**A shot's length can be set to auto from the strip, not only from inside the
card.** The duration head's "auto" was on the seconds pill in a shot's own
editor and nowhere else, so setting it on a strip of eight meant opening eight
cards — in the one view where the lengths are actually laid out side by side,
the seconds were a readout. They are the switch now, on any family that has a
duration head, and a card on auto wears the same `~` its estimate already wears
on the strip's total and inside the editor. Not on a shot inside a merged pass:
what is sampled there is the pass's total, so a per-shot switch would be
offering the model a number nothing reads.

**The model pill leads every node's row, in the same slot on all four faces.**
Which architecture renders a piece was in two different places and neither was
findable: on the pre-stage it stood mid-row between the frame pills and the
canvas, and on the video nodes it was inside the sampler row, behind the
Sampling settings disclosure, between the face pass and the weights. It is a
sampler setting nowhere — it decides what every other pill on the body *means*:
which routes exist, what the seconds round to, which checkpoints the routing
pill cycles. So it now opens the row that says what the render is, in the same
slot on all four faces — a shot, a strip's summary, the strip window's bar, and
both pre-stages, where the slot names an image architecture instead of a video
family. The weights pill stays on the sampler row: those are file paths, set
once when a checkpoint is installed.

**A preset keeps the whole sampler row, derived from the family's own
manifest.** The list of settings a preset carried was written down rather than
read off the family, and it was H3's list from before three of H3's own controls
existed: the attention pick, low VRAM and fast math were dropped by every preset
that claimed to keep the row, and it carried the retired `sage` switch, which is
the one thing the pack exists to *clear*. On LTX 2.5 it kept `steps` and the
sampler name — the two settings both families spell the same — and dropped the
cfg pair, the sigma curve, the stretch and the new guidance. On an Ideogram 4
pre-stage it carried a step count that architecture does not have and missed the
quality that is most of what its row is. All four lists are one derivation now,
off the same manifest the controls are drawn from.

**A preset no longer puts one family's row or weights onto another family's
piece.** A row and a set of weights belong to the family they were captured on —
both video families spell `steps` and `sampler_name` and mean different things
by them, and no weight slot is shared at all — so those two sections are now
refused across families, with a reason naming both. Everything else on the
preset crosses as it always did. Applying a preset's weights also reads them
under the target piece's own slot names, where before it read them under H3's:
on an LTX 2.5 piece that meant every file the preset was keeping came back
empty.

**Two of Lightricks' own guidance patches for LTX 2.5 — detail and lip-sync —
with their cost stated on the pill.** Two of Lightricks' own patches, off by
default and drawn in their own group beside the sampler row rather than among
the accelerators — because they are the opposite trade. Detail guidance re-runs
each step with the chosen transformer blocks' self-attention degraded and steers
away from it, which sharpens spatial detail and steadies motion; a/v sync
re-runs each step with the audio-to-video attention severed and pushes toward
the coupled prediction, which is what tightens lip-sync. Each is an extra
forward pass per step, so on the distilled weights either roughly doubles the
time of the stage it runs on and both roughly triple it — which is in the
tooltip, since it is the only thing worth deciding on. A pill is lit exactly
while it is costing that, and a piece that leaves them alone builds the same
graph it always did.

**Live previews on every render, not only H3 renders with a taeh3 decoder
picked.** The preview override was only ever emitted when a tiny decoder had
been picked, which made a decoder look like the thing that turns previews on. It
is not: it is a quality setting *inside* KJNodes' node, and the node itself is
the only thing that previews these renders at all — ComfyUI ships with previews
off, and where they are switched on the frontend paints them onto the canvas
node rather than into the body. So an LTX 2.5 piece, and any H3 piece whose
owner had not downloaded taeh3, sampled for ten minutes behind an empty box. The
node is now emitted whenever KJNodes is installed, on both families and on both
of LTX's sampling stages. Without a decoder it draws latent2rgb — colour without
detail, animated across the clip — and on LTX through KJNodes' own LTX
previewer, which knows to crop off the guide frames the sampler appended.
Picking taeh3 still does what it always did, on the family that has one.

**Fixed: the stage card sized itself to the decoded picture, so a latent preview
landed as a postage stamp.** The card declared a column but never `display:
flex`, so the media row had an automatic height, the picture's `height: 100%`
had nothing to resolve against, and it fell back to the decoded file's own size
— while the card's width sat on its 240px floor because shrink-to-fit reads an
image's intrinsic width and ignores any cap on its height. Neither showed while
the only preview in the pack decoded at roughly the render's own shape. A
latent2rgb frame is the latent — 30×17 on an LTX canvas — and it landed in the
corner of a full-height card as a postage stamp. The card is a flex column now
and takes its shape from the media it was handed, which is the mechanism
`Stage.setAspect` already fed the fullscreen dock. The dock had the other half
of the same fault: it took the picture's shape *and its size* from what was
inside it, so the full-size frame it holds while you wait handed over to a 30×17
card adrift in the column. It is the largest box of the picture's shape the
column will hold now, at whatever the corner grip is set to.

**Fixed: sampler pills on LTX 2.5 wrote settings the render never read.** Two
faults with one shape. The store's field list was H3's, written down, so an LTX
2.5 piece kept `steps` and lost the rest of its row on the way through —
`video_cfg`, the sigma pair, the stretch — dropped on load and on save both,
which meant a pill moved on that family changed the render until the workflow
was saved and then quietly stopped. The list is each family's own declarations
now, derived from the manifest, so a family added to the pack turns up in the
store without anyone editing the browser half. And the row on the piece's face
was drawn against a second `{value, set}` pair over the node's widgets, left
behind when the row moved into the blob: the turbo switch wrote its six steps
and euler where the render takes them from while the row went on showing twenty
and res_multistep, so the switch looked inert and a step count dialled after it
was overruled by a blob it never wrote. One pair now, the blob's.

**Fixed: switching families lost the weights and kept H3's routing, including
its turbo LoRA.** Three faults, one root: the weights layer knew which family a
piece renders with and the routing layer did not. A piece moved to LTX 2.5
reported two weights missing when every file it loads had been picked — it was
being asked for `fl2va` and `ref2va`, which are H3's checkpoints and not slots
LTX has — and a LoRA whose checkpoint claim LTX cannot read was taken to claim
both of them, so the H3 distillation the turbo switch had thrown went on being
patched onto a 22B LTX transformer with no switch left on the row that owned it.
A family that ships one transformer now routes between nothing, on both sides of
the pack: nothing is derived, nothing may be pinned, nothing is required, and a
LoRA claims nothing — which means every enabled entry is patched onto the one
set of weights there is. The turbo switch's own LoRA leaves with the switch when
the family changes, and the switch is drawn only for a family that declares a
distillation.

**LoRA support on LTX 2.5, through ComfyUI's own loader, with a refusal when a
LoRA patches nothing.** Which loader patches a family's LoRAs is now the
family's own: H3 keeps the vendored stack it needs — the stock loader is wrong
on the quantized checkpoints most people run it on — and every other family goes
through ComfyUI's own, which is what LTX's adapters want. LTX 2.5 takes LTX
2.3's LoRAs, so those work here. Nothing checks a file to decide whether it
belongs, because that is not knowable from the file; but a LoRA that patched
nothing at all now says so and stops the render, instead of leaving you to
wonder why it made no difference.

**The sampler row is set aside per family, so a switch no longer samples at the
other family's numbers.** `steps` and `sampler` are spelled the same on both
families and mean different things — 20 res_multistep steps is H3's row and 8
euler ones is the distilled LTX transformer's — so a row left in place across a
switch was quietly sampling the new family at the old one's numbers. It is now
set aside with the weights and handed back the same way, and the turbo switch is
released into it on the way out: switching a family off is switching its turbo
off, and that means putting the row it overwrote back.

**The weights are remembered per family, and per machine.** Picking six files
was a chore paid twice — once per new node, and once more every time a piece was
switched between architectures, which threw away the block for the family being
left. A piece now sets that block aside under its family's id and takes it back
on return, and this machine remembers the last block picked for each family
beside its other preferences. A node fills an *empty* row from that memory and
never a row the workflow answered, so a saved piece still says what it rendered
on.

**ReDetail: a third upscale answer that re-renders every pass through LTX 2.5's
spatial upscaler, on any family.** ReDetail finishes a piece by re-rendering
every decoded pass through LTX 2.5's pixel spatial upscaler at twice the canvas
— an H3 render included, which is the point: the backend is the piece's choice
and the family is not. Pick it on the resolution popover and the render samples
once at the native edge and comes out at double it, past anything either family
samples at on its own.

It is a repaint rather than a polish. The model invents the fine detail as it
goes, so it is right for soft or generated footage and wrong wherever a face has
to stay the same person or a logo the same logo — the popover says so where the
choice is made, not in a release note. The pass runs after the whole reel, so a
seam still inherits the frames that were rendered rather than the ones that were
re-invented; a strip carrying supplied footage is refused, because a clip is
spliced at the size it already is and the parts of one reel have to match.

Its weights are their own block under the weights popover, headed by the backend
that loads them: a second architecture beside the one the piece renders with. A
piece already rendering on LTX 2.5 fills one row rather than five — the render's
own transformer, encoder and VAEs answer, and only the IC-LoRA is new. Nothing
is loaded until a render actually reaches the pass. Built from ComfyUI's own LTX
nodes, so no third-party pack is needed; the graph and its measurements come
from [Bambushu's ReDetail](https://github.com/Bambushu/redetail).

**LTX 2.5 renders: Lightricks' 22B transformer, Gemma 4 and the two VAEs, with
its own sampler row.** The second video family samples now, rather than being
described and refused. Pick it on the model pill in front of the weights and the
node loads Lightricks' 22B transformer, Gemma 4 with LTX's projections and the
two VAEs; picture and soundtrack come out of one packed latent, guided apart by
separate CFG scales. The row is the family's own — 8 steps at cfg 1/1 on the
distilled transformer, a sigma curve with a stretch and a terminal — because a
node's widget list is static per class and LTX's controls are not a subset of
H3's. The frame grid is 8n+1 at 24 fps and the native canvas is 960 × 544, both
off the model card.

Attach a first or last frame and it becomes a real guide on the 8-frame grid;
chain shots and the seam's inherited run rides in the same way. **References are
carried in the prompt text and encoded from nothing** — a guide is a keyframe,
and pinning a character sheet at frame zero is not what citing a reference means.
The grammar that replaces H3's ordinal citations here is IC-LoRAs, and choosing
it is the next phase's work; the render proceeds and says so in the log rather
than refusing.

**The upscale pill runs Lightricks' own trained x2 second stage on an LTX
piece.** Not the H3 refine, which re-encodes the request at a larger canvas: LTX
ships a trained x2 latent upscaler, so the piece samples at the native edge, the
upscaler takes the video latent up, and a tail of the schedule runs again. The
factor is the model's, so the resolution slider chooses *whether* there is a
second stage rather than how big it is, and the pill says which.

**Every control asks the piece which family it is, so a single-transformer
family draws no routing.** The weights popover, the sampler row, the LoRA
manager, the resolution and aspect pills and the mode badge all read the piece's
family instead of the one family this pack used to have. A family that ships one
transformer draws no route control, no per-LoRA checkpoint choice and no mode →
checkpoint arrow, because there is nothing for any of them to say. Nothing about
an H3 piece moves: the graphs it builds are byte-identical, and a workflow saved
before any of this names no family and is H3 for good.

**A shot on LTX 2.5 can pick its own length, from the model's duration head.**
The seconds pill grows an "auto" switch on a family that has weights to answer
with — LTX's duration head, picked in the weights popover — and the model reads
the shot's own prompt and chooses its length while it renders, inside the
trained 1–20 s. It cannot be asked any earlier: the prediction runs the
transformer's caption connectors over the encoded prompt, so it needs the whole
model loaded. So the number on the pill becomes an estimate while auto is on,
wears a `~`, and is what the strip's bar and the queue's length guard go on
counting with. H3 has no such weights and so is not offered the switch.

**A seam blends at the run its own family's VAE can encode — 5/22/39 on H3,
9/17/25 on LTX 2.5.** The picker's short, medium and long are the runs a
family's video VAE takes standalone, which on H3 is 5, 22 and 39 frames and on
LTX 2.5 is 9, 17 and 25. This matters more than it sounds: LTX crops a guide to
its own grid silently, so an H3-shaped blend reached it as a single frame while
the strip went on subtracting five — a seam that had quietly stopped being a
seam. The strip's length readouts, the queue guard and the reference-length
match now all ask the piece which family it is, for the same reason.

**A merged pass on LTX 2.5 is written as native multishot prose instead of H3's
markup.** One generation holding several shots is what Lightricks means by
multishot — this pack has always had the control, as `merge` and one-pass mode.
What it did not have was the right *description*: every family's merged pass was
assembled in H3's Context-IR form, so LTX received `[Shot 1] … [Shot 2] At
00:05.000, …`, which is markup its captions are defined by never containing. A
merged LTX pass is one flowing paragraph now, its shots in play order, with
nothing invented — you name the cut yourself ("a hard cut transitions to…"),
which is what the model was taught to read. Nothing about an H3 pass changes.
Past four cuts in one generation the pass wears the same off-distribution mark a
too-long duration does, because four is what Lightricks' guidance prefers.

**Fixed: a blended seam also pinned its final frame, but only on shots without
references.** Blending a seam hands the previous shot's last run of motion to
the model as context; on top of that, the text encoder was also being shown that
run's final frame and told to arrive at it exactly — a still pinned against the
motion meant to carry through. Worse, it only happened on shots without
references, so the same seam behaved differently depending on what else was
attached to the card. A blend now speaks for itself. If you want the old
behaviour — the blend *and* a hard statement about where it lands — the seam's
blend picker has a switch for it, and an unblended seam is unchanged, since
there the frame is the whole seam.

One knock-on worth knowing about: a blended seam with an end frame attached now
correctly describes one picture to the model instead of claiming two.

Requires a ComfyUI new enough to ship the LTX-AV nodes; without them the node
says so by name instead of failing three hooks deep.

## 2.26

**Fixed: a long reference video could exhaust VRAM on the second sampler pass.**
A reference video is `latent_t` copies of its own grid, not one, so ten seconds
at `max` is around two hundred thousand conditioning tokens — longer than the
clip being generated, and every row of it rides through every sampling step. At
that length the widest tensor in the model is the first projection of each
block's SwiGLU, gigabytes of it, and a branched LoRA held three of them at once:
the layer's own output, a delta of the same shape, and the sum that allocated a
third. That third allocation is what ended a render on a 32 GB card, on the
second sampler pass where the branch bank is attached, having got through the
first pass on the same shapes. The branch now adds into the tensor the layer
already returned, so it costs the rank-width intermediate and nothing else.
Unscheduled branches stay bit-identical; a scheduled one moves by the last bit,
because the add happens inside the matmul now instead of after it.

What that cannot do is make the sequence shorter, and a long reference at `max`
still costs what it costs. Accelerators → chunked feed-forward splits the same
arithmetic over the sequence and is free — it is arithmetic rearrangement, not a
trade — and `match` on the reference itself is the other half of the answer.

**Recommended: a ComfyUI carrying H3's seven special tokens (ComfyUI PR
#15808).** The released tokenizer declares `<d>`, `</d>`, `<|cutoff|>`,
`<|lyrics_start|>`, `<|lyrics_end|>`, `<|caption_start|>` and `<|caption_end|>`
in its config and nowhere else, and ComfyUI did not add them, so the dialogue
tags this pack writes were tokenized as two pieces of ordinary text apiece
rather than as the token the model was trained on. [PR
#15808](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/pull/15808), merged
2026-08-22, adds them. Nothing here needs to change to get it — the prompt is
handed to ComfyUI as text and tokenized there — but it is worth updating for,
and worth knowing that it changes results: a prompt carrying dialogue or lyrics
renders differently afterwards on the same seed, in the direction of
correctness. A prompt with no `<d>` in it is unaffected. There is no minimum
version and this is not a floor; a ComfyUI without the PR runs everything here
correctly, it just spells the dialogue tags worse.


**Cast entries on the reference shelf are marked and named, so a duplicated segment no longer looks like it copied them.** It
never did — but that is what it looked like, and it was reported twice. A piece
of one shot keeps its cast's photographs on that shot's own row; the moment a
second card exists they move onto the piece, because card 2 cannot see card 1's
row. Duplicating a segment is the ordinary way to get that second card, so two
new entries appeared on the reference shelf at the press of the copy button,
wearing fresh `@ref-N` handles, reading "cited nowhere yet", directly above a
cast shelf still showing the same two faces. Nothing was duplicated and nothing
was billed twice, and none of that was visible.

Those entries now say what they are: marked with their own colour down the left
edge, named for the member they belong to, and reporting which shots write that
name rather than which prompt writes the handle. Removing one says whose face it
takes with it. Marked rather than hidden, because a shelf that draws only some
of what a piece carries is not an answer to what a piece carries.

**Cast members get their own identity colours instead of all sharing the first
one.** The identity hue — the colour a chip in the prompt shares with the file
on the asset row and the card on the shelf — is worked out from the handle, and
it was worked out by counting: `img-2` is the second hue, `ref-4` the fourth. A
cast member's name counts nothing, so every member in every piece fell to the
same first colour, and the shelf's five coloured edges were one colour five
times. Names are now spread over the same eight by their letters. Files keep
exactly the colours they had, because those are in every piece already; only the
names move, and a member keeps theirs across a reload.

## 2.25

**References are encoded once and cached between renders, keyed on the file,
canvas and VAE.** Attaching a video or a cast member means decoding it and
pushing it through the VAE, and on a high-resolution source that is most of the
wait before the first sampling step. None of it depends on the prompt — but a
generation caches on its whole request, so editing one word paid for all of it
again. References are now kept between renders, keyed on the file, the canvas
they were encoded at and the VAE that encoded them; the prompt, the seed, the
sampler, the LoRAs and the other references are all free to move. A cached
reference is never opened, either: the decode is deferred, so a hit does not
touch the disk the clip is on.

That makes `max` affordable. It was the better-looking setting you paid for on
every render, and `match` was the answer; now it is paid for once per canvas and
the choice goes back to being about quality.

The store survives a restart. It lives under ComfyUI's user directory, beside
the settings file and the picker's thumbnail cache, and not under temp, which
core empties on startup — a cache wiped by a restart would pay for `max` again
every morning, and the whole argument is that the reference has not changed. It
drops what nothing has read in a month, or whatever is least recently read once
it passes its ceiling.

It cannot change what a render produces — only how long it takes. Settings →
General → Reference cache turns it off, empties it, and sets its two limits: how
long an unread reference is kept, and how large the store may get. Both rails
travel a list of stops rather than a range, because nobody is choosing between
30 days and 31 — and the size rail carries a gauge of what the store is actually
holding, drawn against the thumb, so a ceiling is set against a real number
instead of a guess. Past the thumb is over, and says what the next render drops.

**The terminal reports what each reference cost and whether it came from the
cache.** A reference being decoded and encoded is most of the wait before the
first sampling step, and it used to happen in silence — which also meant there
was no way to tell a working cache from a broken one. Each reference now says
whether it was reused and from where, or that it is about to be encoded and then
what that cost, and each generation ends with one line saying how many of each.
A miss announces itself before it runs, not after, because the point is to
explain a wait while it is happening:

    [MiniMax] @vid-1 video (max): encoding, nothing cached
    [MiniMax] @vid-1: decoding beach-plate.mp4
    [MiniMax] @vid-1 video (max): encoded in 24.3 s, cached 40 MB
    [MiniMax] @cast-2 image (max): reused from disk (18 MB)
    [MiniMax] @vid-1 soundtrack: reused from disk (420 KB)
    [MiniMax] references: 2 reused (18 MB), 1 encoded in 24.3 s

**Fixed: cached references could never be reused after a restart.** They did
not. A reference's key includes the VAE that encoded it, and that was worked out
by reading the loaded object — including `downscale_ratio`, which on the H3
video VAE is a tuple holding a lambda. Its text is a memory address, so every
restart gave every video and image reference a new key and none of them could
ever come back off the disk. The audio VAE sets that attribute to the plain
number 800, so reference *sound* hit every time, which is what made the failure
visible at all. A checkpoint is now identified by its file, stamped like any
other, and its name travels down the graph beside the socket it is on.

**A fresh node opens on a seed of its own instead of 0.** The default was 0, and
this node pins the after-generate control to "fixed" — so 0 was not a starting
point, it was the seed every first render anyone made ran on. Now a node dropped
on a canvas draws its own. Not a "better" seed: golden seeds are found by
ranking a thousand of them against one model's own output and the winners differ
from model to model, so there is no number to borrow for H3. Every seed is one
noise sample. What was wrong with 0 is that it was everybody's. A saved workflow
is untouched — its seed lands after the node is built.

**Settings' third tab is renamed General.** It carries a Rendering group as well
as a Nodes one, so "Nodes" was the name of half of it.

## 2.24

**A shot can be set to the length of the sound or footage it is generated
against.** A card's length and a reference's never met: the pill set one, the
segment editor set the other, and the difference was spent silently — every
reference video is cut down to the card's own frame count on the way to the
model, and a music cue longer than the shot is sent whole against a shot that
ends before it does. The duration pill now says how long the reference runs and
sets the card to it in one press, the segment editor draws the card's length on
the clip and cuts to it from the other side, and the reference card says which
of the two is happening. Every clip counts, a cast member's voice and the clip
they stand in for included; where a card carries several, the one offered is the
one its length leads — a line of dialogue over a long plate the shot only takes
a look from.

**A matched card carries a real frame-grid duration instead of a rounded
second.** Frame counts come 17 apart, which is 0.708 s, and whole seconds do not
cover that grid: the nearest card to a 6.6 s cue is 6.58 s, and rounding to 7
lands two thirds of a second late. Matching writes the real duration, the pill
shows its two decimals, and a step from there returns to whole seconds.

## 2.23

**A reference the prompt stops naming is muted rather than deleted.** Deleting
`@img-1` used to take the file, the handle, the narrowing and the trim with it.
It stays on the row now, dimmed and out of the run — the same switch a LoRA
carries, with a glyph beside the ✕ to work it by hand on any reference.

**The reference row shows the same files in both fullscreen views.** The simple
view hid the cast's own pictures; a row that draws only some of what is attached
is not an answer you can trust once a file can be sitting there muted.

**Fixed: pressing a name in the prompt stopped opening the cast drawer after the
card was rebuilt.** Which view a card is drawn in was remembered on the editor,
which is rebuilt whenever the segment under it changes — so in the simple view
the press put up a drawer that view hides, and only a round trip through the
full view cured it. The body remembers it now.

**"+ Add shot" is a pill in the row, on both card faces.** Growing a piece a
second shot was a dashed rule across the whole body, which the simple view hid
outright — leaving the face people write single shots on with no way to add one.
It is `+ Add shot` in the tail of the row, on both faces.

## 2.22

**Fixed: duplicating a card left an unclaimed second copy of a cast member's
picture (#27).** A cast member's files live on the card while a piece is one
shot, and move into the project references the moment it grows a second one —
they have to be somewhere every card can see them. Duplicating the only shot
does both at once: the copy makes the piece a strip, and the move that follows
only ever looked at card 1. So the original's picture was promoted to `@ref-3`
and the clone kept a second copy of the same file under the handle the original
had worn, claimed by no member, invisible in the cast shelf and paid for again
at queue time. The copy now follows the file it is a copy of, and prose that
named it follows the rename. Reported in #27.

**Fixed: the fullscreen editor's Render button was refused on some ComfyUI
frontends (#27).** The button queues one node rather than the whole graph, and
the argument that says which node means two different things depending on which
frontend reads it: 1.47 and 1.49 and later take `{queueNodeIds: [...]}`, while
1.44, 1.45 and 1.48 take the whole argument *as* the list and forward it to the
server untouched. On those the server looked for the node id among the keys of
an object, counted no output nodes, and refused the prompt — "The prompt has no
outputs", about a graph whose output node was on screen. It is sent as a bare
array now, which is the one shape all of them read alike. Reported in #27.

**A refused prompt hands the Render button back instead of leaving the row
saying "Sampling".** ComfyUI catches a refusal itself — it puts the dialog up
and answers as though nothing went wrong — so the row went on saying "Sampling"
over a render that was never queued, and the only thing left to press was
Cancel. The row now spends its optimism on the queue actually accepting
something.

**The turbo lead-in states what it needs up front instead of failing deep in the
sampler.** Its second sitting starts with the noise switched off, and ComfyUI
before 2026-08-11 built that noise from the picture alone — H3's soundtrack was
not in it, and the first step died on a tensor size that named neither the
lead-in nor the fix. The render now stops before anything loads, with the
version to update to and the setting to turn off.

## 2.21

**The pack takes its colours from ComfyUI's palette, so it follows any theme
rather than forcing dark.** Every colour in the pack was a literal — around
three hundred of them across the stylesheet — written for a dark desk and drawn
unchanged on a light one, so the Appearance settings had no say over any node
this pack puts on the canvas. All of them now derive from two variables ComfyUI
writes for whatever palette is in force: the ground it draws chrome on and the
colour it writes text in. Surfaces, borders, the quiet weights of text and the
films over video are mixed from those two, in oklab rather than sRGB so that a
step that reads as one step off near-black still reads as one step off
near-white. Because the palette variables are written for *every* palette and
not only for light and dark, this is not a light mode — it is Nord, Solarized,
Github, Arc, and any palette you built yourself. The amber accent, the three
role hues and the eight reference hues stay the pack's own: they identify
something rather than describe the palette. The one concession is that the amber
is drawn a shade deeper on a pale palette, because amber on white is not a
colour a word can be written in.

**A text size setting on the Appearance tab, over every size in the pack.** One
multiplier over every size in the pack — the node faces, the fullscreen editor,
the timeline, the picker, and the settings page itself, which is why the words
move as you choose. A multiplier rather than a set of named sizes because the
sizes were never a scale: fifteen distinct values, each chosen against the thing
beside it. Text and the controls that carry it move with it; the room around
them and the picture do not, which is the line between a text size and a
magnifier. Nothing of ComfyUI's own moves with it.

**A surface separation setting, for palettes whose own contrast is slight.** The
surface ladder is proportional to a palette's own contrast, and some palettes
have very little to be proportional to: on Github, Nord and Solarized the four
surfaces came out close enough together to read as two. One multiplier pushes
all four rungs further off the ground or pulls them closer, and it works on any
palette, including ones that do not exist yet.

**A "Dark in fullscreen" setting, so a frame is judged against a dark ground on
a light desk.** A frame judged against white is judged against the wrong thing,
which is why the tools that cut and grade are dark. "Dark in fullscreen" keeps a
dark ground for the fullscreen editor whatever the desk is set to. It stops
there deliberately: a node body sits inside a node ComfyUI draws in its own
palette, so pinning the body dark on a light desk does not give you a dark
editor, it gives you a dark island in a white card. Node faces keep following
the palette.

## 2.20

**Casting a look from the style atlas no longer copies its frame into your input
folder.** The style atlas ships its thousand frames inside the pack, but casting
one used to fetch the picture back out of the browser and upload it into
`ComfyUI/input/style_refs/` — purely so it would have the kind of address the
rest of the pack understands, which is a path under input/. The copies were
permanent and one per look ever cast: a shelf of catalogue frames in the picker,
and a row in every core LoadImage combo on the canvas, for a file that was
already on disk twice. A look's frame is now cited where the pack ships it,
`atlas:000123`, and two resolvers know that address — one for the browser and
one for the graph. Frames cast before this keep working: they are ordinary input
files and nothing stopped reading them, so the old `style_refs` folder is yours
to delete once no saved workflow points into it.

## 2.19

**The tool rail lays tools out in columns, so the labels stop running
together.** A tool is a square with a label under it, and the label is the wider
of the two — "Add image" is half again the width of the box above it — so a gap
tuned to the squares left barely two pixels between one word and the next, and
the rail read as one run of prose with pictures over it. Every tool now occupies
a column of the same width, wide enough that the space between two labels is
space. The squares keep their rhythm; the words get their own.

**In the window the tool rail is a grid that wraps by tool.** Two things were
wrong with it as a wrapping row. Each row spaced its own contents, so a row of
eight and a row of three shared no vertical line anywhere. And the two clusters
— what writes this shot, and what outlives it — were unbreakable blocks, so the
machine's three fell to a line of their own the moment the column narrowed,
leaving a hole across the end of the row above them. Fixed tracks and clusters
set to display:contents answer both. The one-line rail on the simple card keeps
its hairline between the clusters; a rail that wraps by design cannot mark
anything with one, so it does not try.

**Fixed: the refiner's chevron hung outside the tile at the window's smaller
size.** It was placed by two offsets that suited the node face's 56px square,
and the window draws a 44px one — so in the shell it hung out past the tile's
right edge, over the gap beside it. The tile is a token now (`--mmc-tool-tile`),
the chevron is measured from it, and the three places that draw a smaller tile
set the token rather than a width.

**Fixed: on the simple card, clicking a name a second time did not close the
cast drawer.** Clicking a name in the sentence is the only thing that puts it
there, and clicking the same name takes it away — that second press had stopped
working. The body the card borrows is the node's own, `nodeId` and all, so the
question "is the drawer a row of me?" was answered by asking whether there was a
node behind it, which is yes for both views and true of only one. The card says
which view it is now, and the answer decides both halves of the gesture. While
the drawer was up-but-hidden it also kept the gap either side of it: a host with
a hidden row in it is still a row of the column, so the card carried the
drawer's space without the drawer. Empty hosts stopped costing a gap generally,
which is where the rest of the slack over the prompt came from.

**The prompt box's placeholder says what "/" does as well as "@".** It answers a
slash with the cast library, the input folder and the style atlas — somewhere to
bring a thing in from, where "@" cites what is already attached — and nothing on
screen said so. The placeholder named one opening and read as the complete list
of what the box does; it names both now.

**The pre-stage and the shot are drawn the same height.** They were two cards
centred on the ground, each as tall as its own contents, so the step before the
shot ended somewhere up the side of it and the pair read as debris rather than
as a row. They are wrapped in a row of their own now, which is only as tall as
the taller of them: same top edge, same bottom edge. The difference goes above
the button rather than below it, so Render still and Render sit on one line.

## 2.18

**A cast subject is a list of features, and each one can be kept or changed on
its own.** The reference guide writes a subject as a named list — "with thick
white fur, pointed ears, a dark nose, and a curved tail" — and names those same
features again in `retention_analysis`. A cast card holds that list, and every
line in it is either kept or has an arrow in it:

    long dark hair                 kept
    a blue cardigan             →  a red waxed jacket
    a thin silver necklace         kept

That is the answer to a question the node had no answer for: what if the clothing
should be different. The cardigan is named in the definition, because section 4.1
is "the referenced content is still used, but some defined characteristics are
changed" and a characteristic has to be defined before it can be changed, and the
retention line says which are retained and what the changed one became.

**The relationship marker is derived from the features you changed instead of
picked from a menu.** All features kept is `fully_preserved`; any feature
changed is `partially_preserved`; taking somebody's place is
`attribute_transfer`. It was a menu of four words that changed nothing but the
word — picking *partly kept* wrote `partially_preserved` above a sentence saying
everything was retained, which is a marker you can set and a sentence that
ignores you. The override survives as the only way to reach `weak_reference`,
which nothing can infer from the cast.

**Nothing negative is written into `retention_analysis` any more.** Those lines
used to end "...and the source picture's background, palette, lighting, pose and
action are not", which is a sentence borrowed from what the compiler writes for
a *file*. Section 4.1 closes by saying not to treat what the target video adds
as a loss of reference fidelity, and there is not one negative clause in any of
the guide's four retention examples. `<Subject N>` means content abstracted from
a reference asset — section 2.1 — so the abstraction is already in the label,
and `<Picture N>` is the label that denotes a file and needs saying which parts
of it count.

**"Takes the place of" is a row on the card rather than a menu item behind a
thumbnail.** Writing *@vera should replace the bench in @vid-1* in the prompt
does nothing structural: it lands in `detailed_description` and the two
retention lines beside it go on saying the subject is preserved whole and the
clip is preserved whole, with nothing connecting them. The row is offered on
every open card whenever the piece holds a clip to edit or continue, and filling
it in is what produces the `attribute_transfer` line — their features
transferred onto the bench in `<Video 1>`, whose framing, camera work and action
are kept.

**Fixed: clicking a name in the prompt no longer failed to open the cast
shelf.** Clicking `@vera` or `@lego_brickfilm` in the prompt has been meant to
open them on the cast shelf for several releases and has kept coming back dead.
The handler was never the problem: `PromptBox.refresh` rewrote the box's
children on every render, so the chip a press started on was detached before the
browser could finish the click on it. A press is a pointerdown and a click on
the same element, and any render at all — a pill moved, a probe answered, a
commit landed — took that element away mid-press. No error, nothing in the
console, a chip that simply does nothing. The box now leaves itself alone when
the chips it would build are the ones already in it.

Nothing caught it because the test drove `openCastMember` directly rather than
performing the press, and because the DOM shim under those tests could not match
`.mmc-ref-cast[data-handle]` and answered `false` to `contains` — so the two
guards the real handler runs were both unreachable. Both are fixed, and the
suite now presses the chip, checks that a render leaves it the same element, and
checks that a look opens the same way a person does.

Pressing the same name again shuts the card. The press is its own undo, rather
than leaving you to find the chevron on a card you opened by clicking a name.

And pressing a name no longer selects it. A click on a `contenteditable="false"`
chip is a node selection as far as the browser is concerned, so the name turned
into a blue block and stayed one until you clicked somewhere else — a lot of
noise for a press whose visible result is a panel opening under it. The selection
is cancelled at mousedown, where it is made, which leaves the click that carries
the gesture untouched. A file's chip is not a control and goes on selecting
normally.

Refine is told the features too. Left out, the rewrite would describe the blue
cardigan the reference has while the retention line beside it says the cardigan
is a red waxed jacket — two sections of one prompt disagreeing about one person.

## 2.17

**The prompt box can show the finished prompt the model actually reads, section
by section.** The sentence you type has never been the prompt H3 reads — the
compiler wraps it in the reference guide's sections — and until now the only way
to find out what that came to was to read the console. There is a rail under the
box now — *what the model reads* — and it opens onto the finished prompt for the
pass this shot lands in, set out section by section under the field names the
model is handed. It comes from the compiler itself rather than being rebuilt in
the frontend, so there is no version of this where the two disagree. On a
timeline it follows the merge — cards merged into one pass share one prompt —
and it says which pass you are looking at.

It opens *under* your sentence, not in place of it. The first cut of this was a
pair of tabs that swapped the two, which was wrong three ways: the tabs sat on
the box's own `<summary>`, so a click that missed one folded the whole prompt
away; the panel re-read on every render and dropped every answer but the newest,
which while renders kept arriving was never the one that had landed, so it stayed
empty; and swapping meant that on a shot with nothing to declare — where the
compiler correctly adds nothing but a wrapper — the second view looked like the
first and read as broken. Stacked, the block holding your own sentence is marked
and everything around it is what the compiler added, which is the question the
panel exists to answer. A shot with nothing to declare says so in as many words.

This replaces the scope band, and the setting that gated it. *Reference scopes
in the prompt* is gone: every reference is defined and scoped now, always. It
was off by default, which meant the ordinary render handed the tokenizer three
files and told the model what none of them were for — and section 2 of the guide
is the whole rebuttal, since a label the prompt never defines is a label
pointing at nothing. There is no reading on which the old default was the better
prompt, so there is no longer a switch for it.

**A reference generation is written in the reference form whether or not you
refine it.** The three sections that are not the description —
`subject_definitions`, `summary`, `retention_analysis` — used to arrive only
from a rewrite, so a piece queued without one went out as a bare sentence with
`<Picture 1>` substituted into it: no wrapper, no definitions, nothing saying
what kind of job it was. All three are derived from what you already declared.
The task-type prefix comes off the clips' scope dials (`edit` is `video
editing`, a camera reference is `reference generation`, and the guide says so
itself); the definitions come off the chips; the retention markers come off what
each label was declared to lend. Every label defined now gets a retention line,
which section 4.1 asks for and nothing wrote.

What this does not do is write the guide's 350–500 words of shot description. No
rule turns one sentence into that. It builds the document; Refine still writes
the prose, and a refined section replaces the derived one.

**The prompt form follows what the piece holds instead of which checkpoint it
routed to.** It used to be built only for REF2VA, so a cast in a text-only
generation got two of the sections with the base form's body field — a hybrid
neither guide describes. People run reference-form prompts against T2VA and get
what they asked for; the weights do not police the field name. A piece with
something to declare is now written in the form built for declaring things,
whatever it is about to be encoded as. A bare sentence with nothing to declare
still gets the base form.

**Fixed: two of the four retention markers were words the guide does not use.**
The cast path wrote `transferred` and `reused`; the guide's fixed set is
`fully_preserved`, `partially_preserved`, `attribute_transfer` and
`weak_reference`. So the one field whose vocabulary the guide spells in English
in every language was being handed a token the weights never saw — and on
exactly the case that needs it most, since a subject who stands in for somebody
derives that marker. The refiner's glossary and `prompts/modes/ref2va.txt`
always had the right four; this is the third copy agreeing with them.

**Somebody can stand in for a person in more than one clip.** *They take
somebody's place in this* held a single file, so the same person in a medium
shot and a close-up could not be said: the second clip could only be attached
and left undefined. Both ways of working around it misfired — left at the
default scope the clip compiled to "is a reference video" and nothing else, and
set to `edit` it produced two sentences each claiming to be the whole source of
the edit. The slot takes a list now, the summary names every source in one
sentence, and each clip keeps its own definition and retention line. Two related
fixes fell out of it: the whole-video relationships are defined the way section
2.3 defines them (`<Video 1> is a source video for the target video edit.`)
rather than by borrowing the summary's opening line, and citing a subject
carries every clip they stand in for into that shot — it was adding the list
itself to a set of handles, so it carried none of them and the generation was
refused for a file the citation should have brought with it.

## 2.16

**The fullscreen editor holds the picture still, with history on a shelf under
the window.** The fullscreen editor kept every finished render and the live
stage in one scrolling column, so where the picture you were waiting for sat was
a function of how many you had already made: centred while the column was empty,
shoved to the floor by the first take, further down with every one after it. The
thing you were watching was the thing that would not hold still.

The two no longer share an axis. The picture region takes the whole height and
centres what is in it, always, and history runs left to right along a shelf under
the *window* — under the writing as much as under the picture, which is what keeps
the two level. A shelf inside the picture's own column would have taken its height
out of the picture and not out of the card, and they would have sat half a shelf
apart for as long as there was any history at all. It is reserved from the first
press rather than grown on the second take, for the same reason.

**The elapsed clock keeps its total when the render stops, and every take is
captioned with its cost.** The elapsed readout counted up through the render and
then vanished at the moment it became the answer. It now holds the total, in the
same corner, in the same type — and every past take on the shelf is captioned
with what it cost, which is the one thing about a finished render you cannot see
by looking at it. The filename moved to the tooltip: along a row of thumbnails
it was the same truncated stem eight times over.

**A grip on the live picture's corner sizes it between 40% and full.** The live
picture has a grip at its top right — drag to size it between 40% and full, with
a little gravity at 50, 75 and 100; double-click for full; arrow keys for five
points at a time. It grows and shrinks about its own centre, so nothing else in
the window moves, and the size is remembered the way the Simple/Full switch is.
The bottom edge of a render is spoken for three times over — the progress rule,
the readout, a finished clip's own transport — so the handle is at the top,
where there was nothing.

**The readout over the picture is one kind of chip, and the scrim behind it is
gone.** The readout over the picture used to hold two vocabularies: Gallery was
a pill and everything beside it was bare text on a gradient scrim, so a finished
render carried a dark band across its bottom third to make three words legible.
Every chip now brings its own small ground and the scrim is gone — the picture
ends where the picture ends. The card the picture sits in was carrying a shadow
written for the canvas while the card beside it carried another, so the two
objects in the window sat at two different heights; they match now, radius
included, and the outline drawn before the first render is the same shape as the
picture that replaces it.

**Fixed: portrait renders sat letterboxed in a box as wide as the file.** A card
that hugs a contained image is not something CSS can work out on its own — a
parent's shrink-to-fit width comes from the image's intrinsic width and ignores
any cap on its height — so a portrait render sat in the middle of a box as wide
as the file, letterboxed by its own frame. The stage now measures the media when
it loads and hands the ratio over, which is the one fact the stylesheet could
not derive.

## 2.15

**Fixed: casting a look from the style atlas produced a broken handle and wrote
no chip.** Three things were wrong with it and all three were silent. The atlas
was only read when its tab was *pressed*, so opening the library straight onto
Style — which is what the new `/` door does every time — left the grid on its
empty line, and that line said "The style atlas could not be read" about a read
nobody had started. A look is cast under a handle that has to open on a letter,
and a quarter of the atlas opens on a number, so "2D cutout-paper stop-motion"
arrived as `@subject` while the button that cast it promised `@2d_cutout_paper`
in its own tooltip. And nothing wrote the name into the sentence: the tooltip
told you to go and type it yourself, so there was no chip to click even when the
name was right.

Now the frame casts itself in: `@look_2d_cutout_paper` leads the prompt as a
chip, on the prompt the node is actually showing. Click it to edit the look,
delete it to take the look off the node — picture and all. And casting a second
look replaces the first rather than stacking on it, which is the promise the old
descriptor-swap made and this had quietly stopped keeping.


**Clicking a name in the sentence opens their card in every prompt box, not just the Creator's.** Clicking somebody's name in
the sentence opens their card — that was true on the Creator's face and nowhere
else, so the Timeline window's standing prompt and a card of the strip both drew
chips that changed the cursor and then did nothing. A card's editor was worse
than dead: it looked the piece's subjects up on the segment, found none, and
deleting a chip there took nobody out of anything. Both are wired now, and a
card knows whose cast it is holding. A style is a subject like any other — it
opens the same shelf and leaves the same way, by deleting its name.

**A reference chip shows only what you set, and its handle opens one card with
all of it.** A reference chip used to carry four small buttons — what of the
file is the reference, what part of the clip, its soundtrack, its encode size —
and the simple fullscreen view hid any of them still holding a default. That is
exactly the answer you are trying to leave, so a picture attached in that view
could not be made a style reference at all. The chip now says only what somebody
*set*, and its handle opens a card with all of it: the same card on a node face
and in either fullscreen view.

**`/` in the prompt box searches the style atlas, the cast library and the input
folder at once.** `@` cites what this piece already has. `/` is the layer above
it: the style atlas, the cast library, the input folder. Typing after it
searches all three at once, so `/cla` finds Clara, Claymation *and*
clay-turntable.png without choosing a branch first; the arrow keys go in and
back out. Every row ends in a chip.

The Style branch searches all 941 looks by their whole descriptor — so
"grindhouse", "needle-felted" and "anamorphic" find their entries from the
middle of one — and each row carries the frame it was cut from, so you are
still choosing by looking. Picking one uploads that frame, casts the look, and
writes its name where you typed the slash. The atlas is read the first time a
slash asks about looks and never again, and the way into the full catalogue is
still the last row of the branch.

**Fixed: the Sampling settings toggle did nothing on the Timeline and the
pre-stage.** The simple view folds the sampler row away by a class on its host,
and only the Creator body carried one: the Timeline mounted its bar straight
onto the root and the pre-stage's host had no class at all. Pressing the button
on either did nothing, which is what the screenshot showed.

## 2.14

**The node can take the whole window: Ctrl+Shift+M, or Settings → Editor →
Fullscreen.** Settings → MiniMax H3 → Editor → Fullscreen, or Ctrl+Shift+M, and
the Creator's face stops being a rectangle on a canvas and becomes the screen:
the body in a column at its own width, the picture beside it at its own size
rather than scaled to the zoom, and the PreStage — when one is spawned — in a
column of its own to the left, still the direction the hand-off runs. Escape and
the button in the corner go back to the graph.

Nothing is duplicated to do it. The body is the same element the node mounts, the
blob is the same hidden widget, and the node stays in the graph the whole time —
so the piece is still what `graphToPrompt` serializes and still what the server
runs, and the workflow you save from fullscreen is the workflow you always had.
The node's own title is the piece's name, because LiteGraph already lets you
rename it and already saves it, and inventing a second name would have meant two
that could disagree.

**The fullscreen title bar wears the pack's own mark instead of the timeline
glyph.** It was drawing `timeline`, a rail glyph that means "the strip"
everywhere else it appears, next to the words MiniMax H3. It is the icon the
Comfy registry lists the pack under now — the same artwork, inlined rather than
fetched, so the shell does not go to GitHub to draw its own corner.

**A Render button and a Cancel in the fullscreen shell, which double as the
queue readout.** ComfyUI's are behind the shell, so the piece grows its own at
the foot of its column, and the button is the queue readout as well — it turns
into the step count while it samples and puts a Cancel beside itself. Both call
exactly what the toolbar calls, `queuePrompt` and `interrupt`; neither
reimplements a queue. The Gallery and the Settings page are *not* in the title
bar: they have been in the body's own rail all along, and a second copy would be
two doors into one room.

**Two views over the fullscreen shell: Full, and Simple for a piece that is one
prompt.** The switch is in the title bar. *Full* is the desk described above —
the pre-stage, the shot and the picture side by side, which is what a piece
built out of parts actually looks like. *Simple* is the other half of the day:
one card, for when the piece is one prompt and everything else is in the way.
Nothing that the render reads is hidden in it — the rail, the references, the
cast and the shot's own pills are all still there; the sampler row is folded,
because it is the row you set once and then stop looking at, and *Sampling
settings* beside Render brings it back. Which view you were last in survives a
reload.

**In the simple view the picture column opens beside the card the moment you
press Render.** The card sits in the middle of an empty window while you write,
and the moment you press Render the picture column opens beside it and the card
slides left to make room. It is the same two regions the desk has, in the same
places — writing on the left, picture on the right — with the difference that
the right-hand one is not there until there is something in it. Nothing appears
at a new address, either: the card is on rails between two positions in one
centred row, so opening the column *is* the movement, and there is no second
layout to keep in step with the first. Reduced motion gets the two positions and
nothing between them.

**The simple view stays simple once you have cast, attached and narrowed
things.** Cast somebody, attach a clip, narrow a reference, and the card that
was one prompt in the middle of a window became four rows of chips over a
paragraph of explanation. Every one of those is right on a node face, where it
is the only place the thing can be said, and wrong in a view whose whole point
is that there is one thing on screen. Three things go, and none of them is a
control you cannot reach:

*The cast shelf, and the Cast tool with it.* Everything the drawer does is
already somewhere else and better placed in this view. Casting somebody is the
@ menu's roster — it reads the cast library, and picking a name there attaches
their pictures and writes the name into the sentence in one gesture, which is
shorter than finding them in a drawer, casting them, and then going to cite
them. Building or editing somebody is the library's Cast tab, which has New cast
member, the sheet for their description and their files, Export and Delete, and
sits two tiles along the rail under Presets. And taking somebody out is deleting
their chip: `compile.py` cuts the cast down to the subjects the text actually
cites, so a member nobody writes is not in the render. What was left was a
drawer listing people you can read off the sentence you wrote.

The one thing none of those covers is editing the copy of somebody that lives in
*this* piece — the library sheet edits the library's copy, and casting them again
makes a second person rather than updating the first. So **click their name in
the prompt** and the shelf arrives on them alone, with nobody else open; their
own chevron takes it away again. The chip is `contenteditable="false"`, so a
click on it had nowhere to put a caret and did nothing before, which makes the
gesture free as well as right: the name in the sentence is where somebody is
used, so it is the shortest way to ask what they are made of. It wears the
pointer and lifts under it, everywhere the gesture actually lands — a card's
editor is one shot of a piece whose cast is owned a level up, and there the chip
stays a chip. Deleting one is unchanged: caret, Backspace.

*And the cast's own pictures stay out of the reference row.* Casting somebody
attaches their files, so one person in a shot grew a chip saying what the @name
in the sentence already says — and in this view the sentence is the only place a
subject is written, which made the chip a second and worse copy of it. The row is
what *you* attached now: the frames, the footage, the references. Empty of those,
it goes with them rather than leaving a gap where it was.

*The band that spells out what each reference narrows to*, and the shelf's
standing sentences with it. They describe what the controls beside them already
say, and none is the only place a fact is written. (That band is opt-in in
Settings to begin with.)

*Any narrowing nobody changed.* A reference chip's four — the trim, the
soundtrack switch, what the file is taken for, the reference canvas — now say
whether they are still holding their default, and the simple view shows only
what somebody chose. So `@vid-1 whole sound on full max` is `@vid-1`, and a clip
you trimmed to eight seconds still says so.

The dashed "write the next shot" rule goes too: growing a strip is the timeline's
gesture and the Timeline pill is still in the row. Everything dropped is one
press away in the full view, and none of it is dropped from the render — these
are display rules over the same bodies, drawing the same blob.

**In the simple view the pre-stage is a step on the same card, not a second
panel.** There is no room beside one column for another one, and there should
not be — the pair is a sequence, make the still and then make the video out of
it — so a switch at the top of the card says which half you are writing and the
card shows it. Both nodes stay in the graph; the step changes what is in front
of you *and* what Render makes. Grabbing a frame or sending a still to the shot
moves the card to the shot on its own, because that hand-off is the whole reason
the pair exists. The switch is also the only pre-stage control the simple view
has now: pressing *Pre-stage* when there is none spawns one and takes you to it,
and the ✕ on the step you are standing on removes it. The amber pill in the
shot's own row that used to do the spawning is gone from this view — two
controls over one node was one place too many to look. The desk keeps it.

**Render makes one thing: the step you are on, through ComfyUI's partial
execution.** A PreStage is an output node of the same graph the shot is in, so
queueing the graph runs the pair — which is right for ComfyUI's own Run button,
and wrong for a button at the foot of one column that reads as being about that
column. Touching the still's prompt and pressing Render made a still nobody had
asked for, and there was no way to remake the still without also remaking the
clip built on it. Each press now names its node, through ComfyUI's own partial
execution. In the simple view Render runs the step you are standing on; on the
desk, where both are on screen, the pre-stage column grows its own *Render
still* under the thing it makes. Queue both and they queue in the order you
pressed them, which is the order the hand-off runs.

**The fullscreen desk is laid out as cards on a ground, with the shot you are
writing raised.** Three regions used to be three stripes, ruled edge to edge by
hairlines and all weighted the same, which is a window with no place to start
reading. They are cards on a ground now, and only one of them is raised: the
shot you are writing. The pre-stage sits quieter beside it because it is the
step before — a card on the ground where the shot is lifted onto a surface,
rather than a rail, a prompt and a sampler row lying loose on the desk with
nothing round them — and the picture's dock has room around it instead of a
border ending in mid-air. Each column says what it is at the top, because both
faces are built out of the same parts and, unlabelled, the first thing the eye
met on the left was a second copy of the toolbar it was already reading on the
right. Read across, the desk is pre-stage, then shot, then the picture they
make.

The dock's empty frame is also drawn for a Creator and a Timeline now, and not
only for a pre-stage. It never was: the body those two nodes wear could not
answer what canvas it was about to render at, so the whole picture column stayed
blank until the first render landed in it. The box you type into is the one
recessed surface in the room — cut into the card rather than laid on it — so the
eye finds the writing without anything having to be coloured to say so.

The pills are the same pills, in the same colours, with two things taken away
that were only ever noise on a screen: a lit chip keeps its colour in its text
and its border and gives its tinted fill back, so the one saturated area left in
the window is Render; and the sampler's numbers are ruled off from the shot's,
which is most of what made a dozen chips in one heap unreadable. On a node face,
where two or three are on at once and the rail is most of the width, nothing
changes.

**The picture column keeps every render this session made, oldest at the top.**
The stage is one box and `execution_start` clears it, which is right on a canvas
— a card beside a node still showing last week's render while this week's
samples would be a card that lies — and exactly wrong in a window with room for
both, because the reason you queue a second take is to look at it beside the
first. The picture column is a reel now: oldest at the top, the live stage at
the bottom nearest the writing, and it scrolls itself down whenever something
arrives, so what just happened is where you were already looking and history is
a scroll rather than a mode. Past takes do not play themselves — ten clips going
at once is not history — and nothing is copied: an entry points at the same file
the Gallery opens, so closing the editor loses the list and not one render.

**Fixed: a finished video could be painted over the tool rail.** The card is
`position: relative`, and the writing column below it was not, so anything that
got out of the picture column was painted over the rail rather than under it.
The reel's own scroll is the containment; the column is positioned as well, so a
leak would at worst be visible instead of covering a control.

**Shrinking a strip back to one shot moves the cast's pictures back off the
reference pool.** Growing a strip moves the cast's pictures into the reference
pool — they are on card 1 otherwise, where no other card can see them — and
there was no way back down. So a Creator that had ever held two cards kept a
pool forever, and a pool is one of the fields a shot's face has no row for: the
node stayed folded into the strip summary with the toggle drawn dead over "the
reference pool", naming a field nothing on that face could empty. Shrinking back
to one shot now moves them home, handles and citations and all — the promotion
run backwards, with the same filter, so a reference attached to the whole piece
on purpose still belongs to the piece and still holds the strip.

**One height for everything pill-shaped, as a single token.** The route badge
was padding-sized, the strip's open button was 32px and the pills around both
were 38px, which read as three unrelated things in a row rather than as a row.
`--mmc-pill-h` is the one number now, and the next control cannot quietly be a
fourth.

**Fixed: a docked render was cut off by the card it sat in.** The card carries a
flex direction but never `display: flex` — on a satellite it does not need one,
because the card's height is the node's and the picture is sized off that height
alone. In a column the card is sized by the column instead, and without the flex
the row inside it had an auto height that no percentage could resolve against,
so the picture went to its own pixel size and the card's `overflow: hidden` took
off whatever stuck out. The row is a flex row in the dock now, and it is allowed
to be narrower than what is in it.

The caps the face wears — two rows of chips, then scroll; ten lines of prompt,
then scroll — lift inside it. They were there because a node face is a preview
that must not grow the node, which is not true of a screen. And the frame the
dock draws before the first render is a frame you can see now: a hairline at
rgba(255,255,255,.16) across a third of a large screen is a line you have to go
looking for, and a dock that reads as empty is the thing that element exists to
prevent.

**Render stays pressable while a render runs, so takes can be queued up.** The
button disabled itself the moment it was pressed, so lining up three takes and
going to make coffee — the whole reason ComfyUI's own Queue button does not do
that — was refused. It stays pressable while a render runs. What it says
meanwhile is a status, not a lock: *Sampling*, the step count, and how many are
behind it.

**Fixed: cancelling a render left the button reading "Sampling" forever.**
Interrupting a render left the button reading *Sampling* forever, with no way
back to a button short of closing the editor. The stage was listening for the
two ways a run can end, `executed` and `execution_error`, and a cancelled one
sends neither — it sends `execution_interrupted`, which nothing was listening
for. It is now, and the stage clears rather than leaving the last sampled frame
up: that frame is a step of a video that was never finished, and a stage still
showing it reads as a render that landed.

**Deleting a mention now deletes what it named — the attachment or the cast
member.** The @ menu is how a file is attached in this redesign and how somebody
is cast — picking one writes the chip and creates the thing in one gesture — so
the chip *is* the attachment, and deleting it has to be the way back out. It was
not. The file stayed on the reference row and the member stayed on the cast
shelf, both of them invisible to somebody who had just taken them out of the
shot.

Worse for a plain reference: an uncited cast member is cut at queue time and its
pictures with it, but `@img-1` is in `assets`, and everything in `assets` is
encoded and shown to the model whether or not a word of the prompt mentions it.
So deleting the name left a picture conditioning the render exactly as hard as
one the prompt still named. Both are now taken out with the chip.

Only what is no longer written anywhere: a handle the same shot still cites from
its soundscape, or another card of the same piece still cites, stays — the
deletion was of one occurrence, not of the reference. The piece's reference pool
is untouched by this, because it never needed it: an uncited pool asset is
already not injected into any generation. And the diff is over *chips* rather
than over text, so typing your way through a hand-written `@ref-1` never detaches
anything on the way past — a chip is `contenteditable="false"` and is the one
thing in the box that can only be deleted whole.

## 2.13

**A LoRA can be muted instead of thrown away, keeping its strength, checkpoint
and trigger words.** The stack was a row of names with one control on it — the ✕
— so the ordinary question "is this LoRA the reason it looks like that" cost the
strength you dialled in, the checkpoint you pinned it to and the trigger words
you edited, every time you asked it. The name is the switch now: click it and
the LoRA is out of the run, off the checkpoint, its trigger words off the front
of the prompt, and everything you set up still sitting on it; click it again and
it is back. The flag has been in the blob and in `compile.py` since the
beginning — nothing in the interface ever wrote it. Muting the file the turbo
switch owns counts as turbo off, which is what it is.

**A LoRA can be swapped for another in the same slot, keeping its place in the
patch order.** The shuffle button beside the ✕ opens the LoRA grid as a one-shot
picker: one click and the file you pick takes that entry's place, keeping its
position in the patch order, its checkpoint and its muted state, and taking
strength and trigger words from its own sidecar — 0.6 on a character LoRA and
0.6 on a distill are not the same number. Which makes trying the other version
of a style two clicks rather than a removal, a search and a re-dial.

**The timeline draws the piece's LoRAs, with their names, mutes and strengths.**
The strip window drew a pill counting the stack and nothing naming it, so on a
piece with a global LoRA there was no mute, no strength and no filename anywhere
on screen — the only way to find out what was patched onto every segment was to
open the manager over it and read the lit cards. It draws the same chips the
Creator face does, under the bar, and the node's own strip face carries the
names beside the count. One implementation of that chip now, shared by all three
faces, rather than two near-copies and a hole.

**Clear takes the cast with it.** It emptied the prompt, the references and the
shots and left the people behind — a shelf of subjects no `@handle` in the piece
named any more, each of them still pointing at reference files the same press
had just deleted, and all of them still riding down onto the blank card the
piece went back to. The cast is written alongside the prose that cites it and
goes with it.

## 2.12.2

**Fixed: deleting a cast member wrote them back to disk on the way out.** The
sheet flushes on close, and the flush ran against the row that had just been
deleted — writing their body file back and then reading an index row that was
gone.

## 2.12.1

**Fixed: pasting into the prompt box also pasted a node onto the graph.**
ComfyUI decides a paste belongs to the graph by asking whether it landed on an
`<input>` or a `<textarea>`. The prompt box is neither — it is a
contenteditable, because the `@` references are atomic chips a textarea cannot
hold — so every Ctrl+V at a caret in there also dealt out whatever was last
copied on the canvas. That clipboard lives in localStorage and outlasts
restarts, workflows and subgraphs, so what landed was often a node copied weeks
ago, once per paste, stacked on the Creator and only found on the way out of the
editor. The box now keeps its own paste to itself, and its copy and cut with it.
One consequence worth knowing: pasting an image while the caret is in a prompt
box no longer builds a LoadImage node, because that went the same way. Thanks to
@MrUSBEN for the report (#22).

## 2.12

**LoRAs load through a branch built for quantized H3, instead of a
dequantize-and-requantize round trip.** The stock path is dequantize, add the
delta, requantize with a recalculated codebook — a round trip that is not
idempotent. It injects about 1.5% relative weight noise where a typical H3 LoRA
delta is 0.01–0.08% of the weight, so on the int8 and w4a8 bakes most people
run, the adapter was being replaced by rounding noise. It is also two orders of
magnitude slower than not doing it. Two more things went wrong without saying
so: H3 ships in a dense and a curve adaLN form, and a LoRA trained against one
has the wrong `lora_A` width for the other, so ComfyUI dropped those pairs — on
a distillation LoRA that is most of the adapter — and the five key conventions
H3 LoRAs are published under do not all survive being split on underscores.

So this pack now ships cicalooo's
[ComfyUI-H3-PowerLoraStack](https://github.com/cicalooo/ComfyUI-H3-PowerLoraStack)
library (Apache-2.0) and loads through it. Quantized layers get an exact runtime
low-rank branch — `y = W_q(x) + B @ A @ x`, the quantized kernel untouched, about
1.5% more FLOPs at rank 64 — instead of a merge. adaLN is changed of basis rather
than dropped. Keys resolve against the model's own key set. A stack of several
LoRAs fuses into one pair per layer rather than one per file. There is nothing to
install and nothing to switch on: it is the path, the way it should have been all
along. Everything the loader did is in the console — what merged, what branched,
what the adaLN port managed, and how far each file's real perturbation is from
the strength you gave it, which is the number that says a LoRA is being run at
five times the strength its author meant.

Vendored rather than wired in, which is the opposite of what this pack does with
the caches and Spectrum, and for the opposite reason: those are accelerators, off
by default, and a copy of somebody else's tuning goes stale. This is not optional
and not tuning — it is what correct looks like — and a user who did not install a
pack would have got all three failures silently, with a finished render and no
sign anything was wrong. Two open findings from upstream's own audit are fixed in
the copy: a shared adaLN basis that handed the second curve LoRA of a stack the
first one's fit, and a table-to-table fit that raised on a model whose table was
on the GPU. `h3lora/__init__.py` says what changed and `tools/vendor_h3lora.py`
re-syncs it, patch and all.

**The attention pill is a list — default, sage or kitchen — instead of a Sage
switch.** Sage was a switch, and switches are the wrong shape for a slot that
holds one thing: a model has one attention, and core now ships its own int8
kernel through `ModelAttentionBackend`. So the pill offers **default**, **sage**
and **kitchen**, and picking one is what turns the other off. Kitchen needs
nothing installed — no NVIDIA-only package, no build step — and appears only on
a ComfyUI whose build can actually run it; asked for on one that cannot, it says
so rather than quietly sampling on pytorch attention, which is the render you
did not ask for, finished. A workflow saved with the old switch on still runs
sage, once, and then the list is what decides.

**Two more accelerator pills: low vram (chunked feed-forward) and fast math
(fp16 accumulation).** **low vram** splits H3's feed-forward over the packed
sequence (KJNodes' Chunk FFN), which lowers the peak a render has to fit in and
is the only accelerator here that trades nothing at all — activations are
quantized per token, so chunking is arithmetic rearrangement and the frames are
the ones you would have had. **fast math** lets cuBLAS accumulate fp16 matmuls
in fp16 while this model runs (KJNodes' fp16 accumulation) and puts the flag
back afterwards — and it is worth saying where that reaches, because it is
narrower than it sounds: fp16 matmuls only. The released H3 checkpoints run
bf16, and their quantized layers go through comfy-kitchen's own kernels rather
than cuBLAS, so on the bakes nearly everybody runs there is nothing for it to
change. It is on the row for the fp16 model that would use it, and its tooltip
says all of this rather than leaving it to a stopwatch. Both compose with every
cache, with Spectrum, and with either attention backend, and both survive the
turbo lead-in — they skip nothing, so there is nothing for the lead-in to
protect. They are named for what you get rather than for how they are built; the
packs' own names are in the tooltips, where somebody looking for them will find
them.

**Settings → Nodes → Advanced controls decides how much of the sampler row a
node draws.** It has grown a cache, Spectrum, an attention backend, a turbo
switch with a lead-in inside it and those two, which is a lot of row to read
past on the way to the seed. **Settings → Nodes → Advanced controls** decides
how much of it a node draws: **Standard** is the row most renders use,
**Everything** adds the turbo lead-in, low vram and fast math, and the turbo
lead-in section to that page. It hides, it never disables — a control already
switched on keeps its pill either way, which is the rule the shift pills and the
custom quality row already live by, so turning it off can never change what a
render does.

**The style atlas's 941 descriptors are cut back to the look, without the source
clip's cast and setting.** The Style tab's 941 descriptors are the opening
clause of a dataset caption, split at the first action beat — so a third of them
carried the clip's cast and setting into your prompt along with the medium.
Seventy-two shipped a literal `(S1)`, the dataset's own subject token; a hundred
and sixty-one were cut off mid-word at 250 characters, because that is where the
atlas page truncates. Asking for LEGO also asked for a chef minifig and a
stovetop fire. The clause chain is now walked and stopped at the first clause
that is about *something* rather than about how it looks — 333 of the 941 are
shorter, none came out empty, no `(S1)` survives and the truncations are down to
eighteen. It is a cut, never a rewrite: nothing is invented and no clause is
reordered, the verbatim descriptor is still what the search reads, and the
inspector shows it under **What the clip's own caption said**. A prompt written
before this still gets its long descriptor swapped out when you apply a style
over it.

**Every style ships a full-resolution frame, and "Cast this frame as a look"
attaches it as a reference.** The card stills are 192px — enough to tell one
look from another, not a reference. So one frame per clip is now vendored at the
clip's own resolution, 512 to 1088 across, and **Cast this frame as a look**
attaches it as a `takes: "style"` subject with the distilled descriptor as its
description. This is the answer to "where do I find a still of a 1972
educational puppet show": you do not, the atlas has one. Both sizes are cut from
the same frame of the same clip at vendor time, so the card and the reference
are one moment rather than two. Nothing streams — the frames are on disk and the
whole catalogue works with the machine offline, which is why they are vendored
rather than fetched on demand.

**A cast member can be made in the roster itself, with "+ New cast member".**
Keeping somebody used to mean four surfaces: attach a picture to a node, add a
subject on that node's shelf, point the subject at the picture, press **★**.
Three of those are about a node, and a member is deliberately not about a node —
their files are stored by filename precisely so they outlive the graph they were
built on. So the roster makes its own. **+ New cast member** opens an editor
over the grid: their face and handle, what they are, their files as tiles you
press to say what each one lends them, and their description as a box rather
than the line the inspector had room for. Nothing there reads a node, and there
is no Save — the row exists from the moment you press New, so every edit is a
change to something already in the library. The **★** on a node still works;
there are two ways in now rather than one. Their description reaches their card
too, so a roster of twelve is scanned by who somebody *is* rather than by how
many files are behind them.

**Removing a cast member takes the pictures they were built out of with them.**
Casting attaches files — the `+` on their card does it, and so does taking them
out of the library — so the **✕** undid half of what it was undoing, and the
node quietly accumulated a picture every time you changed your mind, each one
needing to be found on the asset row and removed by hand. Now it takes what that
member alone was built out of. Not a picture a second member is also built out
of, not a file a prompt writes by hand as `@img-2`, and never the piece's pool
from inside one card of a strip.

## 2.11

**A cast library: keep somebody with ★ and bring them into any piece.** A
subject was built by hand on every node they appeared on, which is how the same
person becomes three slightly different people across a project. The **★** on
their card writes them into a cast library — their name, their words, their
retention marker and their references *by filename* — and **From the library**
on the shelf head brings them back into a piece that never had their pictures
attached. Their files attach as they land, as *ordinary references*: an image of
them is an image reference in the reference row under `img-2`, sizeable and
removable like anything else you attached. On a piece of one shot they land on
that shot; on a strip they go to the piece's pool, which is the one list several
cards can cite. A file already attached is used rather than attached twice.

They have a tab of their own in the preset library, the fourth one: a roster, one
card per person, their own picture as the hero and *person · 2 pictures · voice*
under it. Select them and the panel shows every reference at a size you can
recognise somebody at, captioned with what it lends them, over **Cast @anna into
this piece**. Nothing is captured off a node there — a person is kept from the
card you are looking at them on — so the tab has no *Save current setup* and no
*From a render*, while Import and Export work as they do everywhere else.

Keeping them twice keeps them *over* the standing copy: a name is who somebody is,
and there is one of them. Casting them into a piece that already has an `@anna`
lands them as `@anna_2` instead, because two subjects of one name is a piece where
the name means neither.

**The cast library is reachable from the sentence — type `@` and pick them.**
Type `@ann` in any prompt and the roster is in the menu under **Cast library**,
below whoever is already cast — their own face on the row, and *person · 2
pictures · voice* under their name. Picking them casts them and writes their
name in one press: their files attach as references, and their name is written
in at the `@` you typed. The name goes in by character offset rather than by
caret — casting them rebuilds the box the caret was sitting in, and a caret does
not survive that where an offset does. Somebody already cast here is left out of
that half of the menu — they are in the list above under the name they actually
have. A card's prose offers them too, and casts them into the piece the card
belongs to; a PreStage has no piece behind its prompt, so it is offered nobody.

**A file hung on a cast member is scoped to what they are, instead of staying
`full`.** A picture given to @anna as their looks was still scoped `full` —
"what the target video takes from it is what the picture actually shows" — which
is the opposite of what a person reference means, and it was a second setting
nobody knew they had to change. It follows the slot now: their looks take what
they are (person, object, scene or style), their movement clip takes `motion`,
their voice takes `voice`, and the clip they take somebody's place in takes
`edit`. A dial set by hand is left alone, and the only thing that moves one
afterwards is changing what *they* are — their pictures follow them from
`person` to `scene` and a hand-set dial still does not. A piece written before
this is repaired as it loads.

**The cast shelf is a call sheet: one line per member, one open at a time.**
Every member drew a full card, so a cast of six was several screens of fields,
of which five sets were being scrolled past rather than read — on a node face, a
300px scrollport holding one and a half people. A member is a *line* until you
open them: their face, their name, what they are made of, and where they walk
on, which is the whole of what a cast gets checked for. One is open at a time,
and the open one is the card that was always there. What is wrong with somebody
is on their shut line too, in red, so a card that cannot queue is visible
without opening anybody.

## 2.10

**A turbo lead-in: sample the first steps on the checkpoint before the
distillation takes over.** Every H3 distillation LoRA trades the same thing
away: the frames stay good and the model stops listening, because a turbo LoRA
buys its speed by collapsing the schedule and the opening steps are where a
shot's composition and motion are actually decided. **Settings → Nodes → Turbo
lead-in** hands those steps back — one or two of them sample on the checkpoint
with the distillation held off it, then the leftover noise goes to the distilled
model and the rest of the same schedule runs as it always did.

One run, not two: one seed, one step count, one set of sigmas, and the lead-in's
steps come out of the count on the node rather than being added to it. It engages
only where the turbo switch has engaged a LoRA, only when the schedule is long
enough to give steps away from, and only on shots actually wearing that LoRA;
anywhere else the graph is exactly the one this pack built before. The step caches
sit out the lead-in — reusing the opening of a schedule is the thing it exists to
stop — while sage attention stays, since it skips no steps. The refine and face
passes are unchanged: they resume partway down the schedule and the split is not
in them.

**The turbo pill reads "turbo" instead of the whole filename, with the lead-in
settable beside it.** The switch used to spell the engaged file's whole name on
the sampler row — forty characters of
`minimax_h3_turbo_v4_step600_ema_pruned_comfyui`, the widest thing on the row by
a factor of four, for a decision made once the day the file was downloaded. The
pill reads `turbo` now and names the file in its tooltip, in the picker beside
it and in the weights popover, which is where choosing one already happened.

The room that frees goes to the lead-in, which is settable there: a stepper
reading `lead 2/8` — the steps given back over the steps the run has — sitting
beside the quality stops, next to the `good 8` that set the eight. The fraction
is the whole point, since two of four is half the render on the base weights and
two of eight is a quarter. It writes the same settings file the page does, a
shortcut into one answer rather than a second copy of it.

## 2.9

**A cast: declare who is in the video as `@anna`, and cite them in prose.** You
can say who is in the video now, and not only which files are attached. A
subject is declared on the piece — a name, the references behind it, what of
them is the reference — and cited in prose as `@anna`, the same chip everything
else uses. It becomes `<Subject N>` at queue time.

That is the split H3's reference guide draws and this pack did not: `<Picture N>`
is a file, `<Subject N>` is who the video contains, and an image that only says
what somebody looks like is meant to be cited *inside* a subject's definition
rather than acting as itself. Four photographs are now one person; a face from a
still can walk like somebody in a clip; an audio reference can be bound as a
subject's voice, speaker ID and all; and a subject can stand in the place of the
person in a reference clip, which is "swap this person for that one" said the way
the guide says it — the `transferred` marker, the clip's own framing and camera
work kept.

Having the facts written down makes two sections derivable that previously could
only ever come from the refiner: `subject_definitions` and `retention_analysis`
are now written by the compiler on the direct path, with the shots each subject
appears in read off the finished description. A claimed picture no longer gets a
definition sentence of its own — it is cited inside the subject that claims it,
which is the guide's rule. Refine is handed the cast pinned: it writes the film
around your subjects and is told to define and renumber none of them.

Citing a subject carries their files into that shot the way citing a piece
reference already carried that file, so a shot that never names them costs
nothing. And a name is a citation only because it was declared: `@anna` in a
piece with no Anna in it is prose and stays prose, so nothing already written
changes meaning.

**The cast shelf is on every node's rail, rebuilt around thumbnails of what each
file lends.** It only ever appeared in the Timeline window, and it refused to
open at all until a reference had been attached — so the one prompt that most
needs a cast, a text-only one where a name is all that keeps the same person in
shot 1 and in shot 9, could not have one. Cast is on the rail now, beside Add
image, on every node; the same shelf is still in the Timeline window, and it is
literally the same shelf.

A subject can be a name and a description with nothing behind them, and the two
sections they make derivable are emitted in the base modes too — a `<Subject 1>`
written into a description the prompt never defines is a label pointing at
nothing. The base form is otherwise untouched, and a piece with nobody cast
compiles to exactly the bytes it always did.

The card itself is new. What a file lends a subject — their looks, their movement,
their voice, the place they take — used to be four ghost chips, with the way to
add one a "+" character among them that nobody found. They are thumbnails now,
each wearing the file's own identity hue, each badged with what it lends them,
and one menu behind a tile moves it between the four. The card wears their hue on
its left edge, the same hue `@anna` wears as a chip in the sentence. A subject
nobody has written into a prompt says so, and the readout that says it is the
button that fixes it.

The name and description fields hold the caret, which they did not at first: a
keystroke in a cast field is written straight through to the blob, and writing
to the blob is what redraws the node — so the field was rebuilt between one
letter and the next and you could type exactly one character. The shelf refuses
to redraw while it holds the caret and catches up on the way out, the same
bargain the prompt box and the refine panel already make. Leaving a field defers
its redraw by a turn of the event loop, so a ✕ or a tile clicked while a field
has the caret is not pulled out from under the pointer.

## 2.8

**A generation can take a start frame, an end frame and references at once.**
Frames and references used to lock each other out — attaching one greyed the
other, and a strip could not merge a keyframe shot with a reference shot. The
lock is gone at every level: a generation takes a start frame, an end frame
*and* references (images, video, audio) in one request, a globally cited piece
reference rides into a keyframe segment, a reference shot can end on a clip, and
one pass holds all of it. The frames ride as guides pinned at the clip's own
first and last frame — the same mechanism the continuation seam has always used,
which Ref2VA reads alongside its references — presented after the references so
every `<Picture N>` a cached prompt already has stays put, with an alignment
line naming the ordinals the frames took. Forcing the FL2VA slot onto a
reference generation is honoured now too, instead of refused: the slot names
what you loaded into it, and merges of the two trainings exist.

**The aspect ratio can be taken from any attached picture, or forced to a
preset.** The canvas used to take its shape from the start frame or the first
clip whether you liked it or not — the ratio pill went dead the moment a
keyframe existed. The pill is always live now, and its popover starts with the
ratio's *source*: Auto (the rule that always held), then every attached picture
the piece holds — frames, reference images and videos, clip cards' footage, pool
references — each drawn at its own shape, with the presets beneath them to force
over the lot. Choosing a preset while pictures are on offer writes the choice
down, so footage can no longer quietly outrank a ratio you just picked.

## 2.7.1

**A Preview playback setting, so a stage can hold a clip's first frame instead
of looping.** Every preview used to start playing the moment it existed, and on
a canvas with a dozen finished renders that is a dozen looping clips decoding
for nobody. Settings → Nodes now offers Preview playback: leave it on Plays
itself and nothing changes; set it to Waits for play and the stage holds a
clip's first frame, still, with the browser's controls to start it — sound on
hover and looping unchanged once it is. Covers the finished render and the
animated step previews alike, and it is per-machine like the rest of the
settings file: the workflow says what the piece is, not how your canvas behaves.

## 2.7

**Any refiner template can be pinned onto any request.** The refiner used to
refuse a pinned REF2VA template on a request without @ references, and a base
template on one with them — a first frame plus an always-REF2VA pin got an error
instead of a rewrite, even though the checkpoint handles that prompt fine. Both
refusals are gone: every pin is honoured, and a pin across the reference
boundary comes back with a hint in the result panel saying it may degrade
quality, alongside the rewrite rather than instead of it.

## 2.6

**Clicking a card's number on the strip shoots that card alone.** Building a
piece one expensive generation at a time meant locking five cards to shoot the
sixth, then unlocking one and locking another for every step after it. A card's
number on the strip is now the way to say it: click the 4 and card 4 is the only
thing generated, everything else locked and left exactly as it is. Because a
card locked with a take is a card playing that take, clicking the next number
keeps what you just shot and carries the strip forward — one click per card, for
the whole piece. Clicking a number inside a merged run shoots the run, a pass
being one generation. On a strip that is a single generation the numbers stay
what they were, there being no "only" to ask for.

**Lock all and Unlock all on the strip's bar.** The two ends of that, which
going card by card never reaches: lock everything and the next render generates
nothing and writes the piece out of the takes it already has, which is how a
piece shot in parts is finished. Unlock everything to put the whole strip back
in the pot. They sit on the bar beside Refine all, appear once the strip is
shooting in parts, and Lock all goes dead while there is nothing shot to
assemble from.

**A take can be turned down with a ✕, without deleting the file.** Looking at a
take and deciding against it is half of shooting in parts, and the only way to
say so was to render over it. The chip that names a take — kept, take ready,
kept · edited — now carries a ✕ that forgets it: the card goes back to not shot,
and the file stays under output/, because this is a card saying the take is not
the one rather than a file being deleted. It is out of sight until the card is
under the pointer, so a strip of finished takes still reads as film.

**Fixed: a card shot by itself never wrote its take, so shooting in parts could
not get started.** Shooting one segment, keeping what came back and moving on to
the next is the whole point of the lock — and it never worked. The take a render
writes out was written only where the render had more than one pass in it, which
a strip with five cards locked and one open does not: the take never landed, so
the card could not be kept, so the next render was one pass again, and the strip
never got off the ground. Every place that asked "is there one pass here" was
really asking "is this render the whole piece", and those stopped being the same
question the day a card could be held back. So a card shot alone now writes its
take, says which card it is while it renders, and is named by its own number in
anything it raises — while a strip genuinely generated in one go is still one
generation with one take, which is the render.

**A seam that would inherit from a card held out of the render is refused by
name.** A locked card with nothing to play is dropped from the render, which
moved the card behind it up and left its seam pointing at whoever now sat in
front of it. Shooting card 6 with cards 4 and 5 still unshot opened it on card
3's last frame and said nothing about it — a shot that looks right until the
piece is assembled. It is refused now, naming the card it wanted and the two
ways on: shoot that card first, or turn off the seam and start fresh. Which is
also the rule for shooting out of order, finally stated — a card behind a cut
shoots whenever you like, and a card behind a seam waits for the one it
continues from. The strip says it while the cards are still in front of you
rather than at the queue.

**A named seam source follows the card it names, however much of the strip is
locked.** Pointing a seam at a particular earlier card recorded that card's
number on the strip, and the render read it as a position in the render — the
same number until something earlier was held back, and a different card after
that. It is rebased now, so a seam keeps meaning the card it was aimed at
however much of the strip is locked.

**A card compiles to the same generation however it is shot, so its references
are not re-encoded.** Four things the strip records about a card — the seed it
ran on, the take it has, whether it is locked, and its number — were being
folded into the description handed to the model, which is what the segment's
cache is keyed on. Nothing about the picture changed when they did, so
re-rolling a seed re-encoded the references it was not changing, and shooting
one card of six re-encoded all six. They are kept out of it now: the
conditioning behind a card is reused whenever the card still says the same
thing.

## 2.5

**The picker's places row is a trail with the folders one step in, instead of
every subfolder flattened.** The row of places above the gallery used to list
every subfolder the input or output folder held, flattened — a nested path was
its own chip, and the row wrapped until an output folder filed by day and take
was more chips than gallery, with the pictures pushed off the bottom of the
modal. It is one line now, whatever is in there: a trail on the left saying
where you are, and beside it the folders one step inside, scrolled sideways when
there are more than fit. Clicking a folder goes in, and the grid shows
everything under it however deep, so the chips narrow rather than dead-end.
Leaving is one click on any step of the trail, dragging a file onto a step moves
it there, and the "+" makes its new shelf inside the folder you are looking at.
The preset library's shelves scroll on one line too, and the Move to… menu reads
as the tree it is.

**The picker opens on the folder you left it in.** Each root remembers its own
folder — one for the input tabs, which share a folder and so share the place in
it, and one for the gallery — and the next opening lands there with the trail
already showing, instead of at the top of a folder you then have to find your
way down again. It rides in the same prefs file the stars do, so it follows the
ComfyUI user rather than one browser, and a remembered folder that has since
been renamed or removed quietly falls back to the whole folder.

## 2.4

**A reference's scope can be written into the prompt, not just read by the
refiner.** The `full · person · object · scene · style` dial has always been
prose or nothing — H3 has no reference-conditioning switch, and the DiT is
handed the same tensor whatever the chip says — but until now the only thing
that read it was Refine's glossary, so a piece queued without a rewrite had the
setting quietly do nothing. Settings → Nodes → **Reference scopes in the
prompt** turns on a second reader: the compiler writes one sentence per
reference in front of the description, saying what that file lends and what it
does not. The sentences are shown in the prompt box above your own text, so what
gets sent is readable while you are still setting the chips. Off by default, and
dropped entirely when a refined reference form is what is queued — that form
defines its own labels in `subject_definitions` and scopes them in
`retention_analysis`, and two descriptions of one reference is worse than none.

**Audio references get a scope dial: full, voice, music, ambience or copy.**
`full · voice · music · ambience · copy`, which are the roles H3's reference
guide gives an `<Audio N>`. `voice` carries a timbre and a delivery onto whoever
speaks without carrying the words, `music` and `ambience` reference a style or a
texture without reusing the recording, and `copy` says the signal itself is the
video's own audio — the difference between an `audio reference` task-type prefix
and an `audio reuse` one, and between `reference` and `fully_copy` in the
retention lines. A clip taken for its soundtrack alone scopes here rather than
with the pictures, which is a change: it used to be refused a scope outright on
the grounds that it had no picture left to narrow, and it turns out the thing it
does have is a sound.

**A reference clip says what it lends, with motion, camera, edit and continue
beside the image scopes.** The scope dial that reference images have had — `full
· person · object · scene · style` — is on video chips too, with four more
values that only a moving picture has. `motion` lends the action alone and
carries it onto whoever the prompt puts in the shot. `camera` lends the move,
the cuts and the pacing, with nothing visible in the clip appearing. `edit` says
the clip *is* the video being edited, which is how you replace one subject and
keep everything else. `continue` picks the video up where the clip ends. Each
one becomes a different label in the rewrite: the content takes and `motion`
mine the clip for a `<Subject N>`, while `camera`, `edit` and `continue` ask for
the `<Video N>` entry, retention marker and task-type prefix H3's reference form
gives whole-video relationships. The dial opens as a menu now rather than
cycling, on the card's chip and on the timeline pool's alike, and a clip taken
for its sound alone has no dial — there is no picture left to scope.

**A piece can be shot a pass at a time, with a padlock on every card.** Every
card on the strip carries a padlock: unlocked is in the next render, locked is
not. Write the whole piece, lock the cards you are not ready for, and render the
first one alone; look at it, render it again if it is wrong, and when it is
right lock *it* and unlock the next. The next render generates that card
continuing from the file the first one already made — segment 1 is never sampled
twice. A locked card keeps everything set on it and is simply not generated, so
the strip stays the plan it always was.

Every render of more than one pass now writes each pass as its own file under a
`takes/` shelf beside the finished video, and hands it back to the card that
made it. That is what a locked card plays instead of being sampled: a take is
spliced into the reel exactly as supplied footage is, and the seam after it
inherits its last frame the same way. A card with an unruled-on take says **take
ready**; locking the card is what keeps it. Edit a card whose take is kept and it
says **kept · edited** — the take still plays, and the card no longer describes
it.

The padlock says a card is out of the render; what the card looks like says what
the lock is holding — solid because the film exists, perforated (the mark this
strip already used for film that has not been through the gate) because it has
not been shot — and a chip names it, **kept** or **not shot**. The bar says what
the next queue will make, *6.0 s next* against the piece's length, and the lane
on the node body shows the same picture at a tenth the size. A lock belongs to a
pass rather than a card, since a pass is one generation and there is no half of
one to lock.

**A card can carry its own seed, so a retake does not move the seed of a take
already kept (#17).** New on the seed pill in a card's editor, and absent on
every card until it is rolled there — a piece is one look and the seed is the
handle on it. Retaking is what needs the exception: re-rolling the node's seed
to shoot one card again moves the number that made the take already locked in on
another, so a take's seed is a fact about the take. The pill says which of the
two numbers is in force, and names the one the card's take was made on.

Asked for in [#17](https://github.com/roadmaus/ComfyUI-MiniMax-Creator/issues/17).

**A Clear tool that empties the scene and leaves the setup alone.** A new rail
tool, last in the cluster the add tools are in. It empties what you wrote for
this scene — the prompt, the soundscape and the score, any rewrite over them,
the reference pool, and the strip, which goes back to one blank shot. It leaves
everything you set up once: where the checkpoints are, which LoRAs are patched
onto them, the turbo switch, the canvas, the face pass, the render mode and the
whole sampler row. Irreversible, and one press away from three tools you press
often, so it asks: the first press arms it, the second clears, and five seconds,
Escape or a click anywhere else puts it back. On a piece with nothing in it the
tool is simply unavailable.

**941 looks on a style tab in the preset library, from the MiniMax H3 style
atlas.** A fourth scope beside piece, shot and pre-stage, holding every distinct
visual style in the `ostris/minimax_h3_1k` dataset as indexed by hoodtronik's
[Style Atlas](https://github.com/hoodtronik/minimax-h3-style-atlas) — grouped
into eight media categories, each card a still off the clip the phrase was read
from. These are the exact strings H3 was captioned with rather than adjectives
we thought of, so applying one puts a phrase the model has seen a thousand
frames of at the front of your prompt. It *swaps* rather than replaces: a style
already leading the prompt comes out as the new one goes in, so six looks tried
on one shot is six prompts and not six stacked paragraphs. Nothing else moves,
and it lands on a piece, a card or a PreStage alike. Vendored — the index and
one still per clip, about 5 MB, no video and nothing fetched at runtime — and
`tools/vendor_style_atlas.py` re-reads a fresh clone when upstream grows.

**A trimmed clip and an unnarrowed one no longer both read "full".** An
untrimmed video reference read `@vid-1 full sound on full max` — "full" for the
whole duration, and "full" again two pills along for a reference nobody has
scoped. The duration one is "whole" now, which is what the trim editor's own
tooltip has always called it.

## 2.3

Asked for in [#16](https://github.com/roadmaus/ComfyUI-MiniMax-Creator/issues/16).

**Sage attention is a pill on the sampler row (#16).** H3's own attention, run
quantized — int8 queries and keys, fp8 or fp16 values — through Kijai's `MiniMax
H3 Mem Eff Sage Attention Patch` in
[ComfyUI-KJNodes](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-KJNodes). It is the first
accelerator here that is not a trade of fidelity for skipped steps: it changes
what one attention call costs, so it wants *less* VRAM rather than more, and it
composes with every cache and with Spectrum instead of ruling any of them out.
It goes on first, innermost of the patches, so everything else wraps a model
whose attention is already quantized. Off by default, and switched on without
the pack or the `sageattention` library installed it says so before anything is
queued, the way the other accelerators do. NVIDIA only.

## 2.2.1

All from [#12](https://github.com/roadmaus/ComfyUI-MiniMax-Creator/issues/12).

**Fixed: a piece reference in use was reported as cited nowhere (#12).** The
reference shelf says where each one is cited, and it was redrawn only by a full
render of the strip modal — so writing `@ref-1` into a card left the chip on
"cited nowhere yet" for the whole of the edit that cited it, which is the one
moment anybody is reading it. It keeps up with the card now. The other half is
the case that was actually filed: attaching the same picture to a card in its
own right works, and gives the file a handle of the card's own, so the copy on
the shelf is left uncited and the shelf said so — a reference plainly on screen
in that card, reported as used nowhere. The chip now names the card and the
handle it wears there.

**Fixed: a rewrite blanked an audio field the reply said nothing about (#12).**
Where the node face owns the two audio fields, they were taken from the reply
unconditionally, so a reply with nothing to say about the soundscape blanked one
you had typed — in a box you were looking at. The strip has always taken those
two only when the reply carries them; the face agrees with it now.

**Fixed: undo and Ctrl+B in the prompt box could lose a line break or a
reference chip (#12).** Its DOM is meant to be flat, and everything the box does
keeps it that way, but undo restores the engine's own snapshot and Ctrl+B is the
browser's command on a contenteditable. Reading the top level only meant a
wrapper the engine put there cost the line break it stands for, and a reference
chip inside one came back as its own label — written into the state on the same
keystroke. Text dragged into the box is now held to the plain-text rule that
pasted text already was.

## 2.2

**A face pass: track the face, re-draw it at its own canvas, and paste it back
(#9).** H3 draws a face badly in proportion to how small the head is in frame,
and no upscaler reaches that — an upscaler re-resolves what was drawn, and what
was drawn was a smudge. The **faces** pill on the sampler row switches on a
second, small generation per pass: the face is tracked frame by frame, cropped
to fill its own canvas, re-drawn by H3 itself at a denoise scaled to how large
it already is, and pasted back under a feathered mask. It needs a SAM3
checkpoint, which ships with ComfyUI core; nothing else to install. Asked for in
[#9](https://github.com/roadmaus/ComfyUI-MiniMax-Creator/issues/9).

**A button that puts back the seed the render on screen was actually made
with.** `control_after_generate` rolls the seed the moment a queue goes out, so
the number that made the shot on screen is gone from the UI by the time you
decide you want it. The sampler row remembers what was actually sent and grows a
button that puts it back.

**One seed for the whole piece, instead of `seed + k` per segment.** A timeline
used to run segment k on `seed + k`, so the number on the node named the first
shot's noise and nothing else: no shot after it could be reproduced from what
the UI showed, and re-ordering the strip re-rolled every shot below the card you
moved. The seed you set now carries through every segment — chained or single,
and through the refine and face passes inside them.

One fix rides along: the rewrite box no longer loses the caret after every
character ([#11](https://github.com/roadmaus/ComfyUI-MiniMax-Creator/issues/11)).
Typing in it re-rendered the panel that owned it, which rebuilt the very box
being typed into; it is refreshed in place now. The soundscape and score fields
had it too.

### Coming from 2.1

Nothing to do. The face pass ships off, and a piece with it off renders exactly
what it rendered before.

## 2.1

**Presets: save a node's setup, or read one back out of a render you already
made.** A setup you can put back — the whole node, or the sections of it you
tick. Saved off a node you have dialled in, or read back out of a render you
already made, since the file carries the workflow that made it. The library is
on the rail beside Gallery and Settings.

Two fixes ride along. The settings page no longer resets the fields you did not
touch ([#8](https://github.com/roadmaus/ComfyUI-MiniMax-Creator/issues/8)): a
save is a patch over the file now, so naming a video folder stops putting the
stills folder back. And the picker reads what it needs off the directory entry
instead of asking the filesystem three more times per file
([#4](https://github.com/roadmaus/ComfyUI-MiniMax-Creator/issues/4)) — which is
free on Linux and macOS and was not free at all on Windows, where a large output
folder made an upload look like it had hung. An upload also stops re-listing
anything: the file it just wrote is a row it already has, and the renders folder
was never involved.

### Coming from 2.0

Nothing to do. Presets are additive, and a node with no preset saved behaves
exactly as it did.

## 2.0

The headline is that there is one node now instead of two. Update, restart, open
your workflows — they load and render the same. Nothing about a saved piece has
to be redone; see
[Upgrading from the two-node version](README.md#upgrading-from-the-two-node-version)
for what happens to a Timeline node you already placed.

- **One node, one shot or twenty.** The Creator grew the strip rather than
  handing it to a second node. **Write the next shot** under the prompt turns the
  face into a timeline; deleting cards back down to one brings the shot back.
  A Creator render always was a one-segment timeline underneath — the split only
  ever lived in the UI.
- **Two flow clocks on the sampler row.** H3 samples picture and sound on
  separate schedules, and the row now carries both as **shift** pills. They ship
  hidden (Settings → **Nodes**) because most rows never leave the checkpoints'
  own 12/3, at which no shift node is emitted at all; a value off that schedule
  shows its pill regardless. **turbo** presets them to what the LoRA family it
  engages was distilled against, and puts them back on release.
- **Three cache implementations on one pill.** FirstBlockCache and TeaCache from
  the community, plus core's own EasyCache, which needs nothing installed. One
  cache at a time.
- **References citable in the PreStage prompt.** `@ref-2` becomes `Picture 2` —
  the label core's Qwen-edit encoder writes in front of that slot.
- **The render overlay counts passes**, not segments — *Pass 3 of 5* — matching
  what the strip calls them.
