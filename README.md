# Continuity

One node for AI video and stills in ComfyUI. Write a prompt, attach media with
`@`, press Render. Six model families, all through ComfyUI core, all local
open weights. The one thing that can talk to the outside is the prompt
refiner, and only if you point it at your own server or provider - LM Studio,
Ollama, or a hosted API with your key.

## Install

```
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/roadmaus/ComfyUI-Continuity
```

That leaves one folder, `ComfyUI-Continuity`, inside `custom_nodes/`. Restart
ComfyUI. Nothing to pip install.

### Already have MiniMax Creator installed

Don't clone. This pack was renamed, and GitHub redirects the old address here,
so a pull in the folder you already have is the whole update:

```
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-MiniMax-Creator
git pull
```

The folder name doesn't matter to ComfyUI, so rename it or leave it. If it came
from the Manager, update it there as usual.

Cloning next to the old folder is what breaks. The node ids stayed the same
through the rename so that old workflows keep loading, so two folders are two
packs registering the same ids, and the result is no node in the search at all,
under either name. If you already have both, delete one and restart. Your
presets, settings, favourites and LoRA memory are in ComfyUI's `user/`
directory, not in the pack folder.

## Models

| Family | Makes | Weights |
|---|---|---|
| MiniMax H3 | video with sound, and stills | [Comfy-Org/MiniMax-H3](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/MiniMax-H3) |
| LTX 2.5 | video with sound | [Lightricks/LTX-2.5](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-2.5) |
| Krea 2 | stills | [Comfy-Org/Krea-2](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Krea-2) |
| Ideogram 4.0 | stills | [Comfy-Org/Ideogram-4](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Ideogram-4) |
| Qwen Image Edit | stills, edited from a picture | [Comfy-Org/Qwen-Image-Edit_ComfyUI](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Qwen-Image-Edit_ComfyUI) |
| Flux 2 Klein | stills, edited from a picture | [Black Forest Labs](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs) |

See [docs/models.md](docs/models.md) for which files you need and where they go.

There is also an optional **neural refiner**: NVIDIA's DLSS 5 neural renderer
as a material pass over finished stills and clips (skin, hair, fabric, contact
shadows), through the open-source [MLX-DLSS](https://github.com/iamwavecut/MLX-DLSS)
port, which travels with the pack. It is not an upscaler and it ships with
nothing of NVIDIA's — the weights are extracted from your own copy of the DLSS
DLL on the settings page. See [docs/tools.md](docs/tools.md#neural-refiner-dlss-5).

Every node pack on that list is optional: if one is installed, the matching
pills light up, and if it is not, they say what is missing. The models are
optional in the same way — none of them is downloaded for you, and nothing on
this list ships inside the pack except the three vendored libraries it names.
