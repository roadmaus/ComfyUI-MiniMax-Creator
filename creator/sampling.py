"""How the piece is run, read off the blob instead of off the widgets.

The node declares thirteen sampler widgets — steps, cfg, the sampler and
scheduler, the two flow shifts, and the accelerators — and the frontend hides
every one of them and re-draws them as pills. They were widgets because that is
what a ComfyUI node had, not because anybody wanted them there.

**Which is a problem the moment there is a second model family.** A node's
schema is static per class, and LTX-AV does not want the same row: it samples
through a guider with separate video and audio CFG scales, a stretched sigma
schedule with its own terminal, and none of it is a superset of H3's. Three ways
out of that, and two of them are bad — one node class per family multiplies the
frontend and the menu, and a union of every family's widgets makes every node
wear every other family's controls. The third is to put the row where everything
else about the piece already lives, which is the blob the UI owns.

**Nothing is removed to do it.** ComfyUI restores widget values *by position*,
so dropping a widget silently hands the next one somebody else's value — this
pack has already been bitten once, when adding the two flow shifts made a
nine-entry saved row read `steps` into `shift_video`. The `sage` slot is kept
alive today for exactly that reason and says so. So the thirteen stay declared,
in order, forever; they are already invisible, so keeping them costs nothing.

**The fallback is the migration.** `resolve` reads each field from the blob and
falls back to the widget value, key by key rather than block by block. A
workflow saved before this existed has no `sampling` block and every field falls
through to the widget it always used, so it queues exactly as it did. A blob
written by an older frontend that is missing one field falls through for that
one field alone, which is what makes adding a field later free. And a headless
API queue that never opens the node keeps working for the same reason.

What is *not* here is the seed. `control_after_generate` only exists on a real
widget — it is the frontend's own linked control, not something a JSON field can
carry — and the seed is the one number on this row a user reaches for between
runs. It stays a widget and `creator_node` passes it through.

Nothing in this module reaches the segment node's cache key: `compile.py` builds
payloads out of named keys, so a blob field it does not read cannot land in
`segment_data`. That is what keeps re-rolling the step count from re-encoding
every reference, and `tests/test_golden_graph.py` is what holds it to it.
