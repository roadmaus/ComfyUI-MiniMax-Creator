"""What a model family is, to the render loop.

The graph-side boundary is the family's segment node: it takes `segment_data`
plus loader links and returns `(model, positive, latent, lead model)`. That
tuple is the contract — everything `core/emit.py` does around it (the clip
branch, seam wiring, the reel, the save node, takes) never looks inside a
conditioning or a latent, which is what lets it stay one loop for every family.

A family supplies the parts a checkpoint's training decided: how a payload
compiles, which weights a generation routes to, what the loaders are, how the
segment node is wired, what a sampler subgraph looks like (H3 emits `KSampler`;
LTX will emit a scheduler, a guider and `SamplerCustomAdvanced`), and the
refine and face passes where the family has them.

The hooks receive `sampling`, `acceleration`, `weights` and `run` as the family
shaped them — the loop passes them through and never reads their fields. Two
exceptions, and they are the contract's fine print:

- The object `emit_loaders` returns must expose `.vae` and `.audio_vae` links.
  The reel layer decodes with them, and that layer is family-neutral by
  construction — core's joint AV latent is what `LTXVConcatAVLatent` calls "any
  AV model".
- `weights` must answer `routed(payload)` — the standing route stamped onto a
  payload before it becomes a cache key, or the payload unchanged.

Hooks that create graph nodes must create them in the order they are called:
node ids are assigned sequentially, and the golden-graph suite holds every
family to byte-identical emissions.

**Most of the hooks below have an answer already written.** A family declares a
slot table (`models.Slot`) and gets four of them nearly free: `models.Weights`
reads the blob against that table, `models.Links` builds exactly the loaders
this render will open, `models.check` refuses a slot nobody filled, and
`row.Row` validates the sampler row by declared field kinds. Each family used to
carry its own copy of all four, differing in nothing but its field names. What
is left in a family package after that is what the architecture actually
decided — how a payload becomes conditioning and a latent, and what a sampler
subgraph looks like — which is the part that cannot be a declaration.
