"""MiniMax H3's manifest: the declarations behind every control the frontend
draws for this family.

Nothing here is a second copy of a number. The sampler row's defaults are
`sampling.DEFAULTS`, the weight slots are `slots.SLOTS`, the canvas rules are
`canvas.py`'s — this module only says which *control* each value is behind,
in the vocabulary `families/manifest.py` defines. The bounds and the help
strings are the node schema's own (`creator_node._schema`), under the same
English keys the i18n dictionaries already carry.
