"""H3's segment node — the family's boundary, same as LTX 2.5's.

`MiniMaxH3TimelineSegment` takes one self-contained payload plus loader links
and returns `(model, positive, latent, lead model)`. That tuple is the whole of
what `core/emit.py` knows about a family, and everything the loop does around it
— the clip branch, the seam wiring, the reel, the save node — never looks inside
a conditioning or a latent.

It lived in `timeline.py` beside the reel, the pass readers, the clip nodes and
the save node, which are family-neutral and shared: every family's render goes
through them. Two kinds of node in one module made "what a family brings" and
"what the pack provides" a matter of reading each class rather than of looking
at the tree. LTX 2.5's equivalent has always been in its own package; this is
H3's, in its.

A self-contained payload rather than the timeline plus an index, so that the
cache key changes when *this* segment changes and not when any other one does.

The node id is a ComfyUI registry key named in saved workflows and is frozen —
`MiniMaxH3TimelineSegment` is still what it is called wherever it lives.
