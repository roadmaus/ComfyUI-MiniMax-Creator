"""One generation, as a graph — the loop every family renders through.

Both the Creator and the Timeline own their sampler, and neither can be an
ordinary node because of it: a node that samples has to *be* the sampler, and
ComfyUI has no way to say that except by returning a subgraph. So both compile
their blob to payloads and hand them here, and this emits

    loaders -> segment -> sampler subgraph -> Reel -> Save

once per payload, adding each to the reel the save node writes. The Creator
passes one payload and the Timeline passes one per segment; a single-payload
render is the same code with the loop running once, which is why there is no
second implementation of it and must not be. Everything the two nodes disagree
about — how the blob becomes payloads, what the widgets are called — stays in
the nodes; everything a *family* decides — what the loaders are, how the
segment is wired, what a sampler subgraph looks like — comes in as the `family`
argument (`families/base.py` is the contract, `families/h3/render.py` the one
implementation today).

What stays in this loop is what holds for any family: the routing and progress
stamping, the clip branch, the seam wiring, the reel, the save node and the
takes. The reel layer is family-neutral by construction — core's joint AV
latent is a `NestedTensor` and `LTXVConcatAVLatent`'s own description says
"any AV model" — which is why the loop can decode and spill without asking the
family anything beyond `.vae` and `.audio_vae` on its links object.

The chaining is the only part a one-payload render does not exercise: segment N
starting from segment N-1's decoded last frame. It is driven off the compiled
payload rather than off a flag, so a Creator render simply never asks for it.

**The passes are collected on disk, not concatenated in memory.** They used to
be folded pairwise by a join node, which meant N-1 running totals all held alive
by the executor's cache — O(N^2) in the length of the piece, and 81 GB of
intermediates on a ten-pass 768p strip. A reel is a list of parts that copies
nothing, and each part is a file: the decode happens inside the reel node and
`spill.py` writes what comes out of it straight to disk, because a node's output
is kept for the whole execution and a decoded pass is the largest thing in the
render. `mux.py` reads the parts back a frame at a time. Peak memory is one
pass, whatever the strip is.

**Both ends of that chain used to be the user's problem.** The loaders were five
sockets on the node and the video was two outputs somebody had to wire a save
node to, which made a node built to need no wiring need six. The family builds
the loaders here now, and the tail below muxes and saves. Neither node has a
socket left.

**`set_override_display_id` is what puts the finished video back in the node.**
An expanded node's UI result is broadcast against its own id, which is our id
plus a `GraphBuilder` prefix and is on nobody's canvas. Stamping the parent's id
on the save node makes `execution.py` file its `executed` message under the node
the user is actually looking at, so the body can play what it just made without
anything being faked or wired.

The reel, clip, pass and save nodes keep their `MiniMaxH3*` ids whatever family
renders through them: they are ComfyUI registry keys named in saved workflows,
and frozen for it.

    `labels[i]` names payload i in any error raised about it — "Segment 2", or
    "This generation" where there is only one of them. `unique_id` is the calling
    node's, and is stamped on the save node so the finished video is reported
    against the node the user is looking at. `filename_prefix` is where the
    result lands under output/; the callers get it from `outputs.video`, which
    has already refused anything unusable.

    `cards[i]` is the number on the strip of the card payload i renders, and
    `seeds[i]` its own seed or None for the piece's. Together they are also what
    the save node writes the takes from — see `MiniMaxH3Save` — so a piece
    rendered a pass at a time gets one file per pass to keep as well as the
    piece.

    `weights`, `sampling`, `acceleration` and `run` are the family's own shapes
    and pass through this loop unread — `run` is the family's per-queue context
    (H3's is the turbo lead-in), already normalised by the caller. The two
    things the loop does read are the contract's fine print in
    `families/base.py`: `weights.routed(payload)` and the `.vae`/`.audio_vae`
    links on what `emit_loaders` returns.

    `guide` is the piece's ControlNet guide (`creator/guide.Guide`) or None,
    read off the blob by the caller the same way `run` is. It is family-neutral
    on purpose — the drawing, its strength and its schedule window are the same
    three facts whatever renders them — and the loop's only jobs with it are to
    work out which seconds of it each pass is aimed at and to hand that to
    `family.emit_control`, which is where an architecture finally gets a say.

    `upscaler` is the blob's upscale-backend weights, read by the caller the
    same way the family's are and passed through unread unless a compiled
    payload asks for the pass. It belongs to no family — ReDetail re-renders an
    H3 pass through LTX 2.5's files — which is exactly why it arrives beside
    `weights` rather than inside it.

    `finish` is the family's own finishing pass — H3's guide-LoRA pass
    (`families/h3/guidelora.Request`) — or None, read off the blob by the
    caller through `family.finish_request`. It runs over the written passes
    at the size they were written, so it goes after the loop and before
    ReDetail and the refiner: a re-detailed reel is another size, and the
    refiner draws on whatever leaves last.

    `neural` is the piece's DLSS 5 refiner request (`creator/neural.Request`)
    or None, read off the blob by the caller the way `guide` is. Family-neutral
    like the guide: it runs over decoded frames, so it neither knows nor cares
    what sampled them. Off, it emits nothing; on, one node over the finished
    reel after the loop and after ReDetail — see `neuralpass.py` for why the
    end and not the seam.

    `whole_piece` is whether this render covers the strip the user is looking
    at. Everything below that used to ask "is there only one payload" is really
    asking "is this render the whole piece, made in one go", and those were the
    same question until a card could be held back. They stopped being it the
    moment they could: a card shot by itself out of six is one payload and is
    emphatically not a lone generation. True where nobody says otherwise, which
    is what this assumed before holding existed.

    An AV family generates picture and sound together and they should leave

    were snapped to and so is the family's, not this module's — required rather
    than defaulted, because there is no rate this module could pick that is not
    some other family's.

    `MiniMaxH3Save` rather than core's `CreateVideo` + `SaveVideo`: `SaveVideo`'s
    `codec` is a `DynamicCombo`, whose value is assembled from the frontend's
    dynamic schema rather than being the plain string it looks like, and a
    built graph has no frontend to assemble it. Ours takes the reel and writes
    it part by part.

    The display-id stamp is the whole reason the node can show its own result —
    see the module docstring.

    The quality target is read here, once, and travels into the graph as an
    ordinary input. That is what makes it take effect on a re-queue: an output
    node with unchanged inputs is a cache hit, so a save node that read the
    setting itself would keep writing yesterday's quality until something else
    about the render changed.

    `takes` is what the strip needs back to keep a pass: the card each part
    belongs to and the seed it ran on. Passed as a plain input rather than read
    off the reel, because the reel knows nothing about cards — and passed as an
    input for the same reason the quality target is one, so that keeping a take
