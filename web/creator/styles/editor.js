 * start rather than on every fragment, which is what slicing already does.
 *
 * No ground behind it, and that is the whole of what was learned by looking at
 * it: a tint under a chip that wraps is drawn again on the continuation, and
 * the second block reads as a second line of dialogue. It also put two tinted
 * shapes in a box whose one tinted shape used to mean "a file is cited here".
