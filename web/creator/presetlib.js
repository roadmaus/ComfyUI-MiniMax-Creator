// The preset library: the window you save a setup into and get it back from.
//
// It is the picker's window with a different grid in it — scope tabs where the
// kind tabs are, shelves where the shelves are, search where the search is —
// because a user who has opened the asset picker once has already learned this
// one. What differs is the cell: a preset's content is structure rather than a
// picture, so a 140px square would waste the middle of every one, and the card is
// wide with a line of prose and a line of numbers under its hero.
//
// **The hero is the strip.** The node face already draws the piece as blocks at
// their real relative lengths, merged shots closed up under one casing; that
// drawing *is* the shape of the piece and it is generated from data the preset
// already holds. Where the preset carries a cover — the render it was saved from
// — the cover takes the band and the lane is redrawn as a ruler across its foot,
// so the shape stays legible without competing with the picture.
//
// Nothing here stores an image. A cover is a filename in the output folder and a
// block's picture is a filename the preset had to hold anyway; both are served by
// routes that shipped long before presets did.
//
// **The Style tab is the one exception, and it is a catalogue rather than a
// shelf.** Its rows are the vendored H3 Style Atlas — shipped, read-only, stills
// included — so its cards draw pictures this pack has on disk and its bar has
// nothing to save. It is a fourth scope because that is exactly what it is: a
// style is a thing a preset can be *of*, applicable to all three nodes and
// capturable off none of them. The module that builds those rows is imported the
// first time the tab is opened, and never at boot.
//
// **The Cast tab is a roster.** Its rows are people rather than setups — one
// member each, their pictures named rather than handled, so casting them into a
// piece attaches the files as it goes. Nothing is captured off a node *here*:
// somebody is kept from the star on their own card on the cast shelf, which is
// where they are being looked at, and this tab is where they are found again. See
// `presets.captureSubject`.
