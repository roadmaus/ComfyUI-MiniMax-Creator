// its own count, `stage.js` listened to the same event for its own reasons, and
// every bench and the refine pill tracked a private `busy` flag that knew only
// about its own request in flight. So nothing on the page could say the one
// thing that matters now that this pack's work is queued (`creator/jobs.py`):
// *something else has the GPU*.
//
// Two things live here. `watch` is that shared state — how many are on the
// queue, whether one is running — pushed to whoever asked. `run` is the other
// half: post a job, and resolve when the queue has finished it.
