// difficulty of prompting the model. Typing "@" and picking a file is how a
// person says "use *this* one for their face" without ever seeing a label.

// The DOM is kept deliberately flat: only text nodes and chip spans, never the
// <div>/<br> soup contenteditable produces on its own. Enter inserts a literal
// "\n" (the box is white-space: pre-wrap) and paste is forced to plain text, so
// getValue() is a simple walk and round-trips exactly with what compile.py
// parses.
