/**
 * A piece back down to one shot keeps its references on that shot.
 *
 * The exact inverse of `promoteCastFiles`, and it exists for the same sentence
 * read the other way. Growing a strip moves the cast's files into the pool
 * because they are somewhere only card 1 can see; a strip that shrinks back to
 * one card has no second card left to see them from, and the reason for the
 * pool is gone with it.
 *
 * Without this the pool was a one-way door, and an expensive one: the piece
 * goes on carrying a field a shot's face has no slot for, so `loneShot` stays
 * false, the node stays folded into the strip summary, and the toggle back is
 * drawn dead over "the reference pool" — a field nothing on that face can
 * empty. Add a second card once and the Creator never wears its own face again.
 *
 * The cast's files and nothing else, which is the promotion's own filter read
 * backwards. A pool entry no subject claims was attached to the *piece* on
 * purpose — from the strip's own bar, where that is the only thing attaching
 * means — and it holds the strip open by design: the shot's face has no row for
 * a reference every card shares. Emptying that is the user's to do, and the
 * dead toggle already names it.
 *
 * At one shot the pool and the shot's own row are a single scope already —
 * `castAssets` reads them as one, and `syncCanvas` mirrors the pool onto the
 * segment for compile — so what moves changes address, not meaning.
