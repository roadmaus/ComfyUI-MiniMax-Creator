// The stage: the picture, and nothing at all when there is no picture.
//
// The node makes video and used to show none of it. Everything about a
// generation was legible except the generation — the live preview was latent2rgb
// mush on a KSampler nobody could see, and the finished clip only existed if you
// wired a save node to it yourself.
//
// It behaves like every other preview in ComfyUI, which is the point: **absent
// until there is something to show, and then as large as the node will allow.**
// A box reserving space for a render nobody has asked for is a box permanently
// full of nothing, so the element is display:none while idle and the owner is
// told when that changes. The owner is a Satellite (satellite.js): a card that
// floats at the node's right edge, so the picture arrives beside the controls
// rather than displacing them.
//
// The step count and the clock are overlaid on the picture for the same reason:
// a caption row under the box is space the picture could have had.
//
// **Everything here keys off the node's own id**, because a render is a subgraph
// and nothing in it is on the canvas:
//
// - `progress_state` carries `parent_node_id`, which is exactly our id for every
//   node the expansion emitted. That is how the step readout finds the sampler.
// - core's `b_preview_with_metadata` carries the same field.
// - KJNodes' `kj_preview_override` carries only the emitting node's raw id,
//   which is ours plus a `GraphBuilder` prefix — so that one is a prefix match.
//   Its own frontend looks for a canvas node with that id, finds none, and does
//   nothing, so listening in on it costs that pack nothing.
// - `executed` carries `display_node`, which `render.emit_tail` has already
//   stamped with our id.
