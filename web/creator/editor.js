// Used twice — as the Continuity node's body, and as a timeline segment's
// editor — because a segment is a whole generation and deserves the same
// controls. It owns a state object and calls back when it changes; who persists
// that state, and where, is the caller's business.
//
// Every mutation funnels through commit(), which notifies the owner and
// re-renders. The skeleton is built once and render() only refills the four
// volatile hosts — the prompt box must survive untouched, because rebuilding a
// contenteditable destroys the caret, and attaching an asset from the @ menu
// commits *while the user is typing in it*.
