// The settings page: the preferences that belong to this ComfyUI rather than to
// a workflow. Opened from the rail's Settings tool, beside the Gallery.
//
// The line it draws is `settings.py`'s: a workflow says what the piece is, and
// this says how this machine writes it. Nothing here is saved into creator_data,
// so a `.json` shared with someone else renders the same shot at whatever
// quality their own copy of ComfyUI is set to.
//
// Every control writes through the moment it is touched — the same deal the LoRA
// manager has, and for the same reason: a page with a Save button has a state
// where what you see and what is stored disagree, and Done is then two different
// promises. Done here only closes.
//
// The server is the only copy. Nothing is cached between openings: the file can
// be edited by hand, and a page that showed a remembered value would be showing
// something the next render will not use.
//
// Tabs, because the page answers several questions that are not the same
// question: how good the file is, where it goes, how much of a node face is
// drawn, and how large it is drawn. Every one of them is this machine's rather
// than the workflow's, which is the only reason they share a page.
