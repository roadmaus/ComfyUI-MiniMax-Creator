 * The short-edge control, shared by every node that has one.
 *
 * The one rule that matters here: *nothing inside this may change size while
 * the thumb is down*. A range input maps the pointer's x onto the width of its
 * own track, so a readout that grows by a digit, or a note that wraps onto a
 * second line and widens the popover, moves the track out from under the
 * pointer mid-drag and the value jumps. That is why the readout is tabular, the
 * note holds two lines whatever it says, and the popover is a fixed width
 * rather than one fitted to its text.
 *
 * The steppers are the other half of the answer: on the pre-stage's 512–2048
 * range a step is two pixels of track, which no hand can hit. Arrow keys do the
 * same thing once the slider has focus; the buttons say so out loud.
