// The picture editor: one door onto everything that can be done to an
// attached picture or clip without touching the file — a window on the
// picture (crop), which way up it is (turn, mirror), and on a picture whose
// family can cut, whether the subject is lifted off its background and which
// subject the scissors mean (the SAM clicks).
//
// It used to be three doors: the segment editor's spatial twin for the crop,
// the subject view for the clicks, and a footer link for the scissors. They
// are one thing to the person using them — "this part of this picture, as a
// cutout" — and were three things only because they were built at three
// times. The subject view's whole job lives here now; `trim.js` stays its own
// editor because a stretch of time is a different question from a part of a
// picture.
//
// What it hands back is what the asset stores: the framing blob
// `creator/crop.py` reads — fractions of the picture *as shown here*, after
// the turn and the mirror — and, where cutting was offered, the scissors and
// the clicks as `plate.cut_panel` reads them, fractions of the *framed*
// picture. Here the clicks live in the stage's own pixels, so a click stays on
// the thing that was clicked while the window moves over it, and are
// converted on the way out; a click that ends up outside the window is
// dropped, since it names nothing the matte will see.
//
// Nothing here knows what the file is for. The one thing a host can add is
// the shape of the shot it is going to — `aspect` — so a reference can be
// cropped to it in one press, which is what the pre-stage's "crop it, or set
// the aspect to match" note was asking for.
