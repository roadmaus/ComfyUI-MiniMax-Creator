// The node body, given the whole window.
//
// ComfyUI is where this pack lives, not what it is shaped like. Everything the
// Creator does — the blob, the queue, the previews, the gallery, the picker —
// already works without a canvas under it, and the single thing tying the body
// to a node is where its element hangs. So this borrows the element rather than
// rebuilding anything: `attach()` mounts the body inside a wrapper the DOM
// widget positions, and fullscreen lifts the body out of that wrapper into a
// fixed shell and puts it back on the way out.
//
// **The node never leaves the graph.** It keeps its hidden blob widget, it is
// still what `graphToPrompt` serializes, and it is still what the server runs.
// Nothing here is a second source of truth and closing the editor loses nothing
// — which is the whole reason this is a hundred lines and not a second frontend.
//
// Two things the canvas gave the body for free have to be supplied here:
//
// * **the picture.** On canvas the Stage floats in a Satellite, which derives
//   its screen position from the node's graph position every frame. There is no
//   node on screen to derive it from, so the satellite is *docked* (satellite.js)
//   — it hands the stage to a column and stops following.
// * **the queue.** ComfyUI's Run button is behind the shell, so the shell grows
//   its own, and a Cancel beside it. Render is `app.queuePrompt`, the same call
//   the toolbar makes; Cancel is `api.interrupt()`, the same call its cancel
//   makes. Neither reimplements anything.
//
//   What it does add is an aim. A pre-stage is an output node of the same graph
//   the shot is in, so a plain queue runs both — which is right on the canvas,
//   where the Run button is about the workflow, and wrong here, where the button
//   is at the foot of one column and reads as being about that column. So each
//   button names its node (`queueNodeIds`, ComfyUI's own partial execution) and
//   runs that one. Making the still and making the shot are two decisions, and
//   they were being taken with one press.
//
// What is deliberately *not* here: a Gallery button and a Settings button. Both
// already sit in the body's own rail, at the far edge where `.mmc-rail-group`
// puts them, and a second copy in the title bar would be two doors to one room.
//
// **Two views over the one shell.** `full` is the desk: the pre-stage, the shot
// and the picture side by side, which is what a piece being built out of parts
// actually looks like. `simple` is the other half of the day — one column in the
// middle of the screen, the frame above it and the writing below, for when the
// piece is one prompt and everything else is in the way. They are a class on the
// shell and nothing more: the same bodies, the same state, the same queue, so
// switching mid-sentence keeps the sentence.
//
// **And in the simple view a pre-stage is a step, not a second panel.** There is
// no room beside one column for another one, and there should not be: the pair
// is a sequence — make the still, then make the video out of it — so the card in
// the middle shows whichever of the two you are on and a switch at its top says
// which — and the Render under it runs the step you are on. Both nodes stay in
// the graph either way; the step is what you are writing *and* what you press.
// The desk, having both columns on screen, gives each its own button.
