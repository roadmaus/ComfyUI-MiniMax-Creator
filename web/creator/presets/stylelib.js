// The Style tab's rows, built off the vendored atlas.
//
// `atlas.js` beside this file is generated and is a faithful mirror of upstream
// — category, descriptor, clip ids, and nothing else. Everything this pack
// *decides* about a style lives here, so re-running the vendoring script can
// never quietly undo a design decision. The two halves are meant to be read as
// "what upstream says" and "what we do with it".
//
// A style row is an ordinary builtin preset with one section in it, which is why
// the library needed no new card machinery to show one: it is a `scope: "style"`
// row with `sections: ["style"]`, and `loadBody` hands its body straight back
// without touching userdata, exactly as it does for the shipped starters.
//
// Three things a style row carries that no other row does:
//
// * **`thumbs`** — plain URLs, not the `{path, kind}` asset rows every other
//   picture in this pack is. A picture here is a file the pack ships and the
//   frontend serves out of `WEB_DIRECTORY`; there is no output folder behind it
//   and no thumbnail route to resolve it through. Addressed off `import.meta.url`
//   so the extension's installed folder name is nobody's business but the
//   browser's.
// * **`stills`** — the same frames at the clip's own resolution. A 192px card
//   picture tells you which look this is; it is not a reference, and `encode.py`
//   scales a reference image up to a 2048 short edge, so the source's own pixels
//   are the ceiling. These are what "Cast this frame as a look" attaches, and
//   they are the reason a style is usable on a look nobody has a folder of.
// * **`lead` / `rest`** — the descriptor split for the card. The atlas writes one
//   long clause chain, and a card that set all of it at one size would be a wall;
//   the opening clauses name the medium and the rest is what distinguishes this
//   entry from its twenty siblings, so they are set differently and neither is
//   repeated.
//
// Nothing here is fetched from anywhere but this folder — not at boot, not on
// open, not when a frame is cast. The module is imported the first time the Style
// tab is opened and never again, and the pictures load as the grid scrolls them
// into view. The whole catalogue works with the machine offline, which is why the
// frames are vendored rather than pulled from the dataset on demand.

// ---- the subject, cut out of the style --------------------------------------
//
// A descriptor is not a style phrase. Upstream says so plainly: it is "the
// opening clause of the caption's `integrated_multimodal_description` field —
// the text before the first action beat". The split is by *action*, so a clip's
// scene and its cast ride along in front of the beat and land in the descriptor
// whole. Applied unchanged, asking for LEGO also asks for a chef minifig and a
// stovetop fire, and everybody using this tab deletes half of what Apply wrote.
//
// This used to be cut here, at runtime, by three regexes and a list of nouns —
// fisherman, chef, dentist — written by reading the 941 rows that happened to be
// vendored. Measured against a cut made by hand over the same 941, that rule
// left the scene standing in **four hundred** of them: no noun in its list
// appears in "along a brick-built jousting lane lined with cheering crowd
// minifigs", so nothing fired and the whole chain went into the prompt. It also
// over-cut thirty, dropping real grain and lighting along with the scene.
//
// So the cut is not computed any more. It was made once, per style, reviewed,
// and committed as `tools/style_cuts.jsonl`; `tools/distil_style_atlas.py`
// compiles that into `atlasstyle.js` beside this file, and what is left here is
// a lookup.
//
// Nothing in it is a rewrite of upstream. Every cut is a *prefix* of its
// descriptor's clause chain, so the words are upstream's and in upstream's
// order; the handful that differ inside those clauses are the generalisations
// listed one per line in the decision file, made because fifty-seven descriptors
// carry literal on-screen text that H3 will render as text — a timestamp, a
// scoreboard, `"ROUND 1 FIGHT"` — and thirty weld the lighting to a room.
//
// The verbatim descriptor is kept where it is cut: it is what the search reads
// and what the inspector shows as provenance.
//
// A clip with no decision falls back to its verbatim descriptor rather than to a
// guess, and `test_style_atlas.py` fails when there is one — so a re-vendor that
// adds a style is a red test, not a scene quietly back in somebody's prompt.

// stuttering stop-motion movement"), so it is cut into chips along its own
// joints: commas, "with", "and". The scene clause, where the cut left one, is
// dropped first — an attribute list has no room for a bakery.
//
// Two kinds of chip are marked rather than removed, because they are the
// user's to keep: a name — an artist, a studio, a franchise — resolves the task
// from text alone and the model stops looking at the picture; and the training
// captions never name a subject, so a chip that is one transfers the person
// instead of the style. The rule is the file author's, measured on the
// training set; the list of names is a start rather than a census.

// 35mm" and "under warm set lighting" are film stock and light, and stay.
